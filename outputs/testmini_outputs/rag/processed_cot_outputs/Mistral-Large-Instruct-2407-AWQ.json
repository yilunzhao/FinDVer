However, the statement mentions only $32,253 thousand, which is the value of assets measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs (Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets). The statement seems to have overlooked the $9,893 thousand of assets measured using Level 2 inputs.\n\n2. **Long-term debt carrying value of solar sale leasebacks:**\n   - Paragraph id 89 states that the carrying value of solar sale leasebacks was $296.3 million as of December 31, 2023. The statement mentions $278.4 million, which is the carrying value as of September 30, 2023, not December 31, 2023.\n\n3. **Fair value hierarchy categorization:**\n   - Paragraph id 90 mentions that the Company discloses its debt within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

            " ### Step 1: Read the Given Context and Statement\n\n**Context:** The provided financial document details the operations, history, market share, and financial performance of a company known as Concrete Pumping Holdings, Inc. (CPH), particularly focusing on its U.S. and U.K. operations in the concrete pumping and waste management sectors. The document provides specific data on revenue, market share, fleet size, and other key metrics.\n\n**Statement:** \"The U.S. Concrete Pumping segment, representing 72% of total revenue, significantly relies on its Brundage-Bone and Capital Pumping brands with a fleet of approximately 1,760 units contributing to a global fleet of 1,580 units as of October 31, 2023, indicating the segment's pivotal role within the company's operations.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Document\n\n1. **U.S. Concrete Pumping Segment Revenue Share:**\n   - Paragraph 6: \"Our U.S. concrete pumping services segment represented 72% of our total revenue for the year ended October 31, 2023.\"\n   - This confirms the 72% revenue share of the U.S. Concrete Pumping segment.\n\n2. **Fleet Size of the U.S. Concrete Pumping Segment:**\n   - Paragraph 6: \"which as of October 31, 2023 operated a total fleet of approximately 1,060 equipment units from a diversified footprint of approximately 100 locations across 21 states.\"\n   - This indicates the U.S. Concrete Pumping segment operated approximately 1,060 units.\n\n3. **Global Fleet Size:**\n   - The statement mentions a \"global fleet of 1,580 units,\" which contradicts the addition of the U.S. and U.K. fleets. The paragraphs mention:\n     - U.S. fleet: 1,060 units\n     - U.K. fleet: 400 units\n   - Total: 1,460 units\n\n4. **Fleet Size Discrepancy:**\n   - The statement claims a fleet of \"approximately 1,760 units\" for the U.S. segment, which is substantially higher than the 1,060 units reported in the document.\n   - The global fleet calculated (U.S. + U.K.) is 1,460 units, not 1,580 units as stated.\n\n### Step 3: Document Each Step of the Reasoning Process\n\n- The U.S. Concrete Pumping segment represented 72% of total revenue, which matches the statement.\n- The total fleet size for the U.S. segment is 1,060 units, not 1,760 units.\n- The global fleet size is calculated as 1,460 units, not 1,580 units.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude the Analysis\n\nThe statement provides incorrect information about the fleet size for both the U.S. Concrete Pumping segment and the global fleet, which contradicts the data presented in the financial document.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

            " To verify the given statement, we need to check the following points from the provided document:\n\n1. **Consolidated Subsidiaries**: The statement mentions QVC and Cornerstone Brands as consolidated subsidiaries.\n2. **Competition**: The statement mentions significant competition from various retail sectors.\n3. **Infrastructure and Physical Stores**: The statement mentions that QVC operates through a scalable infrastructure utilizing numerous physical stores.\n4. **Flexible Cost Structure and Efficient Inventory Management**: The statement highlights QVC's flexible cost structure and efficient inventory management.\n5. **Customer Base**: The statement specifies a customer base of approximately 12.1 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\nLet's analyze the provided document to verify these points.\n\n### 1. Consolidated Subsidiaries\nFrom [paragraph id = 0]:\n> Our principal businesses and assets include our consolidated subsidiaries QVC, Inc. (\"QVC\"), Cornerstone Brands, Inc. (\"CBI\"), and other cost method investments.\n\nThis confirms that QVC, Inc. and Cornerstone Brands, Inc. are consolidated subsidiaries of Qurate Retail.\n\n### 2. Competition\nFrom [paragraph id = 10]:\n> QVC operates in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive retail business environment. QVC has numerous and varied competitors at the national and local levels, ranging from large department stores to specialty shops, e-commerce retailers, direct marketing retailers, wholesale clubs, discount retailers, infomercial retailers, and mail-order and catalog companies. Some of QVC\u2019s competitors, such as Amazon and Walmart, have a significantly greater web-presence.\n\nThis confirms that QVC faces significant competition from various retail sectors.\n\n### 3. Infrastructure and Physical Stores\nFrom [paragraph id = 10]:\n> QVC has built a scalable operating infrastructure focused on sustaining efficient, flexible and cost-effective sale and distribution of its products. Since its physical store locations are minimal, QVC requires lower inventory levels and capital expenditures compared to traditional brick-and-mortar retailers.\n\nThis statement partly contradicts the given statement since it mentions that QVC's physical store locations are minimal rather than numerous.\n\n### 4. Flexible Cost Structure and Efficient Inventory Management\nFrom [paragraph id = 10]:\n> Further, since QVC has no set \u201cfloor plan\u201d and can closely manage inventory levels at its centralized warehouses, QVC believes it has the flexibility to analyze and react quickly to changing trends and demand by shifting programming time and product mix. QVC's cost structure is highly variable, which QVC believes allows it to consistently achieve attractive margins relative to brick-and-mortar retailers.\n\nThis confirms that QVC has a flexible cost structure and efficient inventory management.\n\n### 5. Customer Base\nFrom [paragraph id = 10]:\n> For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, approximately 90% of its shipped sales came from repeat customers (i.e., customers who made a purchase from QVC during the prior twelve months), who spent an average of $1,442 each during this period.\n\nFrom [paragraph id = 10]:\n> On a trailing twelve month basis, total consolidated customers were approximately 12.1 million which includes 8.1 million QxH customers and 4.0 million QVC International customers.\n\nThis confirms that QVC has approximately 12.1 million customers as of December 31, 2023.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile most parts of the given statement are supported by the document, the claim about QVC operating through a scalable infrastructure utilizing numerous physical stores is not accurate. Instead, the document states that QVC's physical store locations are minimal.\n\n**Conclusion: Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

There is also mention that the Company engaged Turner, Stone and Company, LLP to conduct its audit for the year ended September 30, 2023, after December 14, 2023.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1.

This part of the statement is **entailed**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The statement is inaccurate regarding net cash used in operating activities being significantly smaller than net cash used in investing activities.\n- The statement is accurate regarding the dividend declaration and the decrease in total stockholders' equity.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed** in part but significantly **refuted** in the crucial comparison between operating and investing activities cash flows.\n\n**Final Determination:**\n```markdown\nTherefore, the statement is refuted.\n```"

However, the document does not explicitly state whether the company generated revenues or not. Since the mention of revenue is absent in the provided text, we cannot directly determine this part of the statement.\n\n2. **Stock-based Compensation Expenses and Issuance of Shares**:\n   - Paragraphs 50, 52, 135, and 137 provide details on stock-based compensation:\n     - The company issued 30,960,000 shares at $0.0168 per share to directors and officers, valued at $520,624 (paragraphs 50 and 135).\n     - The company issued 5,320,000 shares at $0.0168 per share to employees, valued at $89,408 (paragraphs 52 and 137).\n   - This indicates an increase in stock-based compensation expenses through the issuance of shares.\n\n3. **Liquidity Challenges**:\n   - The term \"overcoming liquidity challenges with positive net cash flow from operations and positive working capital\" requires evaluation:\n     - **Net Cash Flow from Operations**:\n       - Paragraph 8 states that the company had a net loss of $1,797,007 and net cash used in operating activities of $267,208 for the six months ended December 31, 2023. This indicates negative net cash flow from operations, not positive.\n     - **Working Capital**:\n       - Paragraph 8 mentions negative working capital of $4,724,913 as of December 31, 2023.\n       - Paragraph 122 confirms a working capital deficit of approximately $4.8 million as of December 31, 2023, and $4.3 million at June 30, 2023.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n- The document clearly shows an increase in stock-based compensation expenses and the issuance of shares as compensation.\n- The company had negative net cash flow from operations and negative working capital, which contradicts the statement's claim of positive net cash flow from operations and positive working capital.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe provided financial document refutes the statement regarding positive net cash flow from operations and positive working capital. The document supports the part of the statement about significantly increased stock-based compensation expenses and issuing shares as compensation. However, it does not provide information on whether the company generated revenues.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

This is a decrease of $41,303,234 or 118.02%.\n\n2. **Net Cash Increase**:\n   - The statement mentions a \"net cash increase,\" but the document (paragraph 116) shows a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $31,903 for the six months ended December 31, 2023. Similarly, the document (paragraph 117) shows a net decrease of $1,620,511 for the six months ended December 31, 2022.\n\n3. **Funding Operations for Twelve Months**:\n   - The document (paragraph 112) states, \"We believe our current working capital position, together with our expected future cash flows from operations and loans from our major shareholder, will be adequate to fund our operations in the ordinary course of business, anticipated capital expenditures, debt payment requirements, and other contractual obligations for at least the next twelve months.\" This aligns with the statement's claim about funding operations for twelve months.\n\n4. **Net Loss**:\n   - The document (paragraph 119) mentions a net loss of $627,911 for the six months ended December 31, 2023, which aligns with the statement's mention of a net loss.\n\n5. **Weak Financial Controls**:\n   - The statement mentions \"weak financial controls,\" but there is no explicit mention of the strength or weakness of the company's financial controls in the provided document.\n\n### Reasoning Process:\n1. The document refutes the claim of a significant increase in working capital; instead, there was a significant decrease.\n2. The document refutes the claim of a net cash increase; instead, there was a net cash decrease.\n3. The document supports the claim that the company believes it can fund operations for twelve months.\n4. The document supports the claim of a net loss.\n5. The document does not provide information on the strength of the company's financial controls.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted** because it incorrectly asserts a significant increase in working capital and a net cash increase, both of which are contradicted by the information in the document."

Without specific details, we cannot definitively support or refute this part of the statement.\n\n3. **\"with approximately 32% of shares controlled by insiders which may block significant changes\"**\n   - The document does not provide the percentage of shares controlled by insiders.

            " To verify the given statement, let's break it down into parts and compare each part with the information provided in the financial document.\n\n1. **Operating Income Increase:**\n   - The statement claims an increase in operating income of $1.1 million for the three months ending December 31, 2023.\n   - However, according to [paragraph id = 81], the operating income actually decreased by $1.1 million (from $0.1 million income to ($1.0) million loss).\n\n2. **Reason for Operating Income Change:**\n   - The statement attributes the change primarily to increased marketing expenses in subsidiaries.\n   - The document [paragraph id = 81] also mentions an increase in marketing and development expenses incurred at Marygold & Co. and Original Sprout, but it contributed to a decrease in operating income, not an increase.\n\n3. **Revenue Decline:**\n   - The statement mentions a $1.0 million revenue decline for six months.\n   - According to the document [paragraph id = 80], the decrease in consolidated revenue for the three months ending December 31, 2023, was $0.3 million. There's no mention of a $1.0 million decline for six months.\n\n4. **Reason for Revenue Decline:**\n   - The statement attributes the revenue decline to decreased AUM in USCF Investments.\n   - The document [paragraph id = 80] also attributes the decrease in consolidated revenue to USCF Investments where AUM for the three months ended December 31, 2023, was lower than 2022.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the statement contains inaccuracies. The operating income decreased instead of increasing, and the revenue decline amount is not accurately reported for the six-month period. Therefore, the statement is refuted.\n\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, the statement is **refuted**."

            " 1. **Reading the Context and Statement:**\n   The financial document provides detailed information about sales and marketing expenses for specific periods. The statement to verify mentions specific factors contributing to the increase in these expenses.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Financial Data:**\n\n   - **Three Months Ended December 31, 2023:**\n     - According to paragraph [101], the increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to a $2.1 million increase in employee-related costs, which includes a $1.4 million **decrease** in stock-based compensation expense.\n     - Contrary to the statement, the increase involves a decrease in stock-based compensation expense rather than an increase.\n\n   - **Six Months Ended December 31, 2023:**\n     - According to paragraph [117], the increase in sales and marketing expenses includes a $4.6 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense.\n     - Paragraph [143] mentions that the increase in adjusted sales and marketing expenses was driven by expanding sales coverage, advertising expense, amortization of costs to obtain contracts, travel and event-related expenses, and licensing fees. Notably, it does not exclude advertising as a primary driver.\n\n3. **Reasoning and Documentation:**\n   - The statement claims an increase driven by a $1.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense for the three months ended December 31, 2023, which contradicts the provided data showing a decrease.\n   - For the six months ended December 31, 2023, the statement suggests that adjusted sales and marketing expenses increased primarily due to expanded travel and event costs, excluding advertising. However, the document explicitly mentions advertising as a significant factor.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   Based on the analysis, the financial document refutes the given statement. The data clearly shows a decrease in stock-based compensation expense and includes advertising as a primary factor for the six-month period.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

The net income applicable to common shareholders significantly dropped due to higher noninterest expenses and increased provisions for credit losses.\n\n### Step 1: Noninterest Income\n- **Data from Table 1:**\n  - Noninterest income for 2024: $11,786 million\n  - Noninterest income for 2023: $11,810 million\n  - Change in noninterest income: $11,786 million - $11,810 million = -$24 million\n\n  Noninterest income actually decreased slightly, not increased.\n\n### Step 2: Market-Making Activities\n- **Data from Table 2 (Noninterest Income):**\n  - Market making and similar activities for 2024: $3,888 million\n  - Market making and similar activities for 2023: $4,712 million\n  - Change in market-making activities: $3,888 million - $4,712 million = -$824 million\n\n  Market-making activities decreased, contradicting the statement.\n\n### Step 3: Net Income Applicable to Common Shareholders\n- **Data from Table 1:**\n  - Net income applicable to common shareholders for 2024: $6,142 million\n  - Net income applicable to common shareholders for 2023: $7,656 million\n  - Change in net income: $6,142 million - $7,656 million = -$1,514 million\n\n  Net income applicable to common shareholders significantly dropped.\n\n### Step 4: Higher Noninterest Expenses\n- **Data from Table 1 and Table 3:**\n  - Noninterest expense for 2024: $17,237 million\n  - Noninterest expense for 2023: $16,238 million\n  - Change in noninterest expense: $17,237 million - $16,238 million = +$999 million\n\n  Noninterest expenses increased.\n\n### Step 5: Increased Provisions for Credit Losses\n- **Data from Table 1:**\n  - Provision for credit losses for 2024: $1,319 million\n  - Provision for credit losses for 2023: $931 million\n  - Change in provision for credit losses: $1,319 million - $931 million = +$388 million\n\n  Provisions for credit losses increased.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe noninterest income decreased slightly despite a decrease in market-making activities, and the net income applicable to common shareholders significantly dropped due to higher noninterest expenses and increased provisions for credit losses. Therefore, the statement is not entirely accurate.\n\n**Conclusion Statement:**\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

            " Let's break down the verification process step by step:\n\n1. **Context Analysis for PMA Approval Requirement:**\n   - The statement suggests that Appyea Inc. needs PMA (Premarket Approval) for their Apnea related devices.\n   - The provided financial document does not explicitly state that PMA approval is required. Instead, it mentions the 510(k) clearance process specifically.\n     - [paragraph id = 110] clearly states: \"Before we can market a new medical device, such as our proposed Apnea related products, we must first receive clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDA.\"\n   - The document does not mention any need for a PMA, which is typically required for higher-risk devices that do not have a predicate device to compare against for substantial equivalence.\n\n2. **Context Analysis for Financial Constraints and Funding Strategies:**\n   - The document discusses financial constraints and strategies:\n     - [paragraph id = 192] states: \"AppYea has experienced operating losses since its inception and had a total accumulated deficit of $6,326,000 as of December 31, 2023.\"\n     - It mentions increasing costs and the need for additional capital: \"We expect the cash needed to fund operations to increase significantly over the next several years.\"\n   - The document does not explicitly discuss \"unique funding strategies,\" but it implies reliance on external financing:\n     - [paragraph id = 277] states: \"The Company intends to continue to finance its operating activities by raising capital.\"\n\n3. **Detailed Analysis:**\n   - The financial document provides specific details on the 510(k) clearance and the financial situation, including operating losses and the need for external financing.\n   - It does not provide direct support for the statement that Appyea Inc. needs PMA approval or specific \"unique funding strategies.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **PMA Approval Requirement:** The provided document only mentions the need for 510(k) clearance, not PMA approval.

It is also mentioned that the New GPO Note \"is subordinate to the Company\u2019s obligations under its Senior Term Loan which limits certain actions that the Company and the Investor may take under the New GPO Note.\"\n\n2. **Outstanding Balance of the Senior Term Loan:**\n   - Paragraph 271 and the table in paragraph 334 confirm that the Senior Term Loan had an outstanding balance of $158,228 as of December 31, 2023.\n\n3. **Interest Rate of the Senior Term Loan:**\n   - Paragraph 316 states, \"At December 31, 2023 the interest on our Senior Term Loan was 13.50%.\"\n\nThe document does not mention a 12.50% interest rate for the Senior Term Loan. Instead, it explicitly states the interest rate as 13.50%.\n\n4. **Interest Rate Alteration with the Prime Rate:**\n   - The statement that \"subject to a potential increase if the Prime Rate changes\" is partly accurate. Paragraph 316 confirms the exposure to changes in the Prime Rate, stating that \"We estimate that a one percentage point increase in the Prime Rate would increase our annual cash interest expense by approximately $1.6 million.\"\n\nCombining all the analyzed details:\n\n- The New GPO Note is subordinated to the Senior Term Loan.\n- The Senior Term Loan has an outstanding balance of $158.2 million as of December 31, 2023.\n- The interest rate on the Senior Term Loan is 13.50%, not 12.50%.\n- The interest rate can change if the Prime Rate changes.\n\nThus, the statement about the interest rate being 12.50% contradicts the information in the document.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

            " Sure, let's break down the statement and analyze each part to see if it is entailed or refuted by the provided financial document.\n\n### Statement Breakdown\n1. **California BanCorp singularly handles ownership and management of California Bank of Commerce located in Sacramento.**\n2. **Regulatory landscape potentially restricts its operations.**\n3. **Heightened risks from large borrower relationships.**\n4. **Dependence on significant agricultural loans.**\n\n### Analysis\n\n#### 1. California BanCorp singularly handles ownership and management of California Bank of Commerce located in Sacramento.\n- In the document, **paragraph id = 0** mentions: \"The Company commenced operation on June 30, 2017 following a reorganization transaction in which it became the Bank\u2019s holding company. This transaction was treated as an internal reorganization as all shareholders of the Bank became shareholders of the Company. As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to regulation and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the 'Federal Reserve'). The Company has no operations other than ownership and management of the Bank.\"\n- Additionally, **paragraph id = 6** specifies: \"Our branch and loan production offices are located in three contiguous counties in the San Francisco Bay Area: Alameda, Contra Costa and Santa Clara; and Sacramento County.\"\n- This information supports the first part of the statement. California BanCorp is indeed the holding company managing California Bank of Commerce, with operations including branches in Sacramento County.\n\n#### 2. Regulatory landscape potentially restricts its operations.\n- The document extensively discusses regulations and supervision that affect the Company and the Bank:\n  - **Capital Adequacy**: \"Bank holding companies and depository institutions are required to maintain minimum levels of capital and are subject to consolidated risk-based and leverage capital rules.\"\n  - **Limitations on Dividends and Stock Repurchases**: The Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends is limited by general corporate law and regulations and policies of the Federal Reserve.\n  - **Branching Regulations**: \"California law permits California banks, such as the Bank, to establish additional banking offices with notice to the DFPI.\"\n  - These regulations could potentially restrict the operations of both the Company and the Bank.\n\n#### 3. Heightened risks from large borrower relationships.\n- The document contains information about risks:\n  - **paragraph id = 6** discusses focus on customer relationships and loans: \"We compete with these institutions by focusing on our position as an independent, commercial business bank and rely upon local promotional activities, personal relationships established by our officers, directors, and employees with our customers... We strive to provide innovative products to our customers that are value-driven... We actively cultivate relationships with our customers that extend beyond a single loan to a full suite of products that serve the needs of our commercial customers.\"\n- This suggests a high concentration of business with large commercial customers, aligning with heightened risks from large borrower relationships.\n\n#### 4.

            " 1. **Analyzing Operating Income Margin:**\n   - The statement claims Family Dollar experienced a significant increase in operating income margin. However, the financial document (paragraph id = 158) shows that the operating income margin for Family Dollar decreased substantially. It was (19.3)% in fiscal 2023, down from 1.0% in fiscal 2022, indicating a decrease rather than an increase.\n\n2. **Goodwill Impairment Charge:**\n   - The statement mentions a goodwill impairment charge of $1,069.0 million. According to the document (paragraph ids = 184, 227, 246, 327), there was indeed a goodwill impairment charge of $1,069.0 million in fiscal 2023 related to the Family Dollar reporting unit.\n\n3. **Trade Name Impairment Charge:**\n   - The statement refers to a trade name impairment charge of $950.0 million. The document (paragraph ids = 186, 227, 326) confirms that there was a trade name impairment charge of $950.0 million for Family Dollar in fiscal 2023.\n\n4. **Net Sales Increase:**\n   - The statement indicates a 7.0% increase in net sales. The document (paragraph id = 158) confirms that the net sales for Family Dollar increased by 7.0% from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement mentioning a significant increase in operating income margin is incorrect; instead, there was a significant decrease. However, the goodwill impairment charge of $1,069.0 million, the trade name impairment charge of $950.0 million, and the 7.0% increase in net sales are all accurate according to the provided financial document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

However, the statement mentions proceeds amounting to $50.0 million. To verify this, we need to check if there were multiple divestitures.\n   - In paragraph id=154, it is mentioned that the company received $100.0 million from the divestiture of the dialysis and BioSentry businesses and $34.5 million from the divestiture of the PICCs and Midline businesses. The sum of these two divestitures is $134.5 million, which matches the proceeds from the sale of assets in the cash flow statement. However, the statement specifically mentions $50.0 million, which does not match the provided data.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the statement is not entirely accurate due to the discrepancy in the proceeds from divestiture.

This improvement in operating profit suggests an increase in operating margins.\n   - Detailed analysis mentions higher pricing, lower material costs, and increased unit and parts sales contributing to improved gross profit, despite higher expenses.\n\n4. **Price-to-Cost Ratio and Freight Costs:**\n   - Paragraph id = 155 mentions maintaining a strong price-to-cost ratio to counter elevated freight and labor costs.\n   - The document indicates strategies to manage costs and maintain margins, which aligns with the part of the statement about maintaining a strong price-to-cost ratio.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe statement correctly mentions the decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses by 18.9% in EMEA and the strategy to maintain a strong price-to-cost ratio.

            " To determine whether the provided statement is entailed or refuted, we need to examine the financial document carefully and analyze the relevant information. Here\u2019s the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant information**:\n   - From the financial document, we need to focus on the sections that discuss purchases of common stock and the plan to purchase common stock.\n\n2. **Extract details about common stock purchases**:\n   - **Paragraph id = 5, 6, 33, 34, and 35** provide detailed information about common stock purchases.\n   - Paragraph id = 5 and 6: It states that during the quarter ended November 30, 2023, 156,910 shares of common stock were purchased on the open market at an average price of $38.08 per share.\n   - Paragraph id = 33: The table summarizes the purchases of common stock for different periods. For the period from November 1, 2023, to November 30, 2023, the table confirms that 156,910 shares were purchased at an average price of $38.08 per share. The table also mentions that the maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the plans or programs is approximately $9,765 (in thousands), which converts to approximately $9.765 million.\n   - Paragraph id = 34: On February 14, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a new plan to purchase up to $50.0 million of common stock.\n   - Paragraph id = 35: The note mentions that amounts shown in the table exclude 251,686 shares of common stock withheld for income taxes on stock-based compensation awards, valued at a weighted average cost of $41.06 per share.\n\n3. **Determine the validity of the statement**:\n   - The statement claims that during the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2023, Franklin Covey Co. purchased 156,910 shares of common stock at an average price of $38.08 per share.\n   - The statement also claims that the potential future purchases under the publicly announced plan are approximately $15.74 million.\n   - The last part of the statement regarding new disclosure controls deemed ineffective by the CEO and CFO is not addressed in the provided financial document.\n\n4. **Analysis**:\n   - The first part of the statement about purchasing 156,910 shares at an average price of $38.08 per share is supported by the financial document.\n   - However, the second part of the statement about potential future purchases worth approximately $15.74 million contradicts the document. The financial document states the value is approximately $9.765 million.\n   - The financial document does not provide information about new disclosure controls being deemed ineffective by the CEO and CFO.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe statement is partially supported but contradicts the document regarding the potential future purchases and does not address the disclosure controls.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

This increase was partially offset by continued investment in employee-related costs and increased amortization related to deferred contract costs and capitalized software. The statement mentions that the increase was partially offset by investments in employee-related costs and increased advertising expenses, which is partially aligned with the document.\n\n2. **Adjusted Sales and Marketing Expenses**: According to paragraph 143, Adjusted Sales and Marketing expense increased for the three months ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by **expanding sales coverage**, an increase in advertising expense, an increase in amortization of costs to obtain contracts, an increase in travel and event related expenses, and an increase in licensing fees. This information aligns with the statement.\n\nNow, let's compare the statement with the analyzed document:\n\n- The statement mentions that Adjusted Operating Income increased primarily due to a **decrease** in total revenues, but the document states it increased due to an **increase** in total revenues.\n- The other factors mentioned in the statement (investments in employee-related costs, increased advertising expenses, expanding sales coverage) align with the document.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement is incorrect because it mentions a decrease in total revenues as the primary reason for the increase in Adjusted Operating Income, while the document states the opposite.

For the three months ended December 31, 2023, research and development expenses amounted to $41,720, and for the nine months ended December 31, 2023, they were $158,637.\n\n#### *Liquidity Challenges*\n- **Paragraph Id = 25:** \"The Company\u2019s operations have been financed primarily through the sales of equity securities and revenue from sales of PGS, telehealth, and research services. ... The Company expects to continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future.\"\n\n#### *GSK Agreement Impact on Revenue*\n- **Document does not explicitly mention the impact of the GSK Agreement on revenue.

            " Let's analyze the provided financial document to verify the statement:\n\n1. **Fleet Strategy Involves Opportunistic Acquisitions and Dispositions**:\n   - Paragraph [2] mentions: \"We actively manage the size and composition of our fleet through opportunistic acquisitions and dispositions of vessels.\" This confirms the first part of the statement.\n\n2. **Enhancement of Invested Capital**:\n   - Paragraph [2] continues: \"We consider timely and selective acquisitions of high-quality secondhand vessels or new-build contracts when we believe those acquisitions will result in attractive returns on invested capital and increased cash flow.\" This aligns with the strategy to enhance invested capital.\n\n3. **Revenue Structure Driven by Fixed Rates**:\n   - Paragraph [12] states: \"Time charters constituted 80% of the Company\u2019s shipping revenues in 2023, 70% in 2022, 71% in 2021.\"\n   - Paragraph [127] mentions: \"We derived approximately 20% of our total shipping revenues and 16% of our total TCE revenues in the spot market and COAs for 2023.\"\n   These indicate that a significant portion of the revenue comes from fixed time charters.\n\n4. **Alignment with U.S. Economic Conditions**:\n   - Paragraph [6] acknowledges: \"Our market position allows us to maintain long-standing relationships with many of the largest energy companies, which in some cases date back many decades.\"\n   - Paragraph [128] states: \"In the Jones Act trades within which the substantial majority of our vessels operate, demand factors for transportation are affected almost exclusively by supply and distribution decisions of oil producers, refiners and distributors based in the United States... The demand for U.S. domestic oil shipments is significantly affected by the state of the U.S. and global economies.\"\n   This confirms the revenue structure's alignment with U.S. economic conditions.\n\n5. **Competition from Other Domestic and International Transportation Options**:\n   - Paragraph [128] mentions: \"...relative price differentials of U.S. produced crude oil and refined petroleum products as compared with comparable products sourced from or destined for foreign markets, including the cost of transportation on international flag vessels to or from those markets.\"\n   - Paragraph [168] states: \"Recent developments on both these fronts have positively affected both the short- and medium-term vessel demand outlook for vessels in OSG\u2019s fleet. First, the significant expansion of domestic crude oil production available along the U.S. Gulf Coast has led to an increase in the demand for shipment of domestic crude oil to refineries in the Delaware Bay...Lastly, the recent approval of projects in Alaska that are expected to add as much as 250,000 barrels a day of new crude oil production by the end of 2027 suggests that demand for ATC\u2019s crude oil tankers should remain strong into the next decade.\"\n   This indicates the existence of competition from other domestic and international transportation options.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll the pieces of the statement are supported by the information provided in the financial document. The company's fleet strategy involves opportunistic acquisitions and dispositions to enhance invested capital, and its revenue structure is indeed driven by fixed rates and U.S. economic conditions, while also facing competition from other domestic and international transportation options.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

This represents a decrease of $0.3 million (paragraph id = 80).\n\n2. **USCF Investments' Revenue Impact:**\n   - The decrease in consolidated revenue was primarily attributed to USCF Investments, where Assets Under Management (AUM) for the three months ended December 31, 2023, was lower than in 2022, resulting in a revenue decrease of $0.3 million (paragraph id = 80).\n\n3. **Marketing and Development Expenses:**\n   - The company's operating loss for the three months ended December 31, 2023, was ($1.0) million compared to operating income of $0.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. This represents a decrease in operating income of $1.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in marketing and development expenses incurred at Marygold & Co. and Original Sprout (paragraph id = 81).\n\n### Step 3: Document Each Step of Your Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Revisiting Revenue Decrease:**\n   - The document shows a revenue decrease of $0.3 million, not $0.5 million as stated in the statement.\n\n2. **USCF Investments' Impact:**\n   - The document confirms that the decrease in revenue related to USCF Investments' AUM was $0.3 million, matching part of the statement.\n\n3. **Marketing and Development Expenses:**\n   - The document states that the overall decrease in operating income is due to increased marketing and development expenses, specifically mentioning Marygold & Co. and Original Sprout, aligning with the statement.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude the Analysis\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement claims a revenue decrease of $0.5 million, but the document shows a decrease of only $0.3 million. The rest of the information in the statement regarding the reasons for the revenue decrease and the increase in losses aligns with the provided financial data.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

However, we can infer that the total spent on repurchases during the three months should not exceed $6.4 billion.\n\n2. **Dividends:**\n   - According to the document (paragraph id = 6), \"Cash dividends declared and paid, at a quarterly amount of $0.52 per class A common stock\" was $(2,120) million or $2.12 billion for the six months ended March 31, 2024.\n   - The statement to verify mentions \"$2.1 billion in dividends,\" which matches the document's six-month data. However, we need the three-month data for precise verification.\n\n3. **Acquisition:**\n   - The document states (paragraph id = 15), \"On January 16, 2024, Visa acquired Pismo Holdings... for a purchase consideration of $929 million.\"\n   - The statement to verify mentions the acquisition of Pismo for $929 million, which matches the document.\n\nAnalysis:\n- The document does not provide explicit three-month data for stock repurchases and dividends, so we cannot definitively confirm the statement based on the given information.\n- The acquisition detail in the statement is accurate according to the document.\n\nConclusion:\nSince the document does not provide explicit three-month data for stock repurchases and dividends, we cannot definitively confirm the entire statement. However, the acquisition detail is accurate.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** based on the lack of explicit three-month data for stock repurchases and dividends."

VOXZOGO's revenue surged due to increased patient intake across all regions.\n\n#### Part 1: Convertible Debt Fair Value\n\n**Step 1: Locate the relevant data in the document.**\n\nIn the financial document, the information about the fair value of the convertible debt is provided in Paragraph 37:\n\n| March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |\n|-----------------|---------------------|\n| 2024 Notes | $ 487,055 | $ 488,288 |\n| 2027 Notes | 596,622 | 619,260 |\n| Total fair value of fixed-rate convertible debt | $ 1,083,677 | $ 1,107,548 |\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the data.**\n\nThe total fair value of the convertible debt on March 31, 2024, is $1,083,677, and on December 31, 2023, it is $1,107,548.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the fair values.**\n\nThe fair value on March 31, 2024 ($1,083,677), is less than the fair value on December 31, 2023 ($1,107,548). This indicates a decrease in the fair value of the convertible debt.\n\n#### Part 2: VOXZOGO's Revenue\n\n**Step 4: Locate the relevant data in the document.**\n\nIn the financial document, the information about VOXZOGO's revenue is provided in Paragraph 68:\n\n\"The increase in Net Product Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 was primarily attributed to the following:\n\u2022VOXZOGO: higher sales volume from new patients initiating therapy across all regions;\"\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the data.**\n\nThe document states that there was an increase in Net Product Revenues for VOXZOGO due to higher sales volume from new patients initiating therapy across all regions.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the analysis.**\n\nBoth parts of the statement are supported by the provided financial document.

This confirms the optimization of distribution costs.\n\n6. **Liquidity Challenges:** The document does not directly mention liquidity challenges. However, it shows a decrease in cash and cash equivalents from $5,171 thousand in January 2023 to $3,805 thousand in February 2024, and an increase in the revolving line of credit from $15,000 thousand to $34,000 thousand. This could indicate liquidity challenges, but it's not explicitly stated.\n\nBased on the above analysis, while the financial document confirms many aspects of the statement, it does not provide information about diversifying sourcing or explicitly mention liquidity challenges. Therefore, we cannot entail the entire statement based on the provided document.\n\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, the statement is refuted."

We need to check for evidence of such investments in the document.\n   - Paragraph ID 155 discusses capital expenditures related to ongoing information technology investments for total talent solutions initiatives. The document mentions capital expenditures of $103.7 million in 2023.\n\n2. **Negative Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n   - The document shows that net cash used in investing activities for 2023 was $412.5 million. This indicates a significant amount spent on investments, contributing to negative cash flow from investing activities.\n\n3. **Accelerated Share Repurchase**:\n   - Paragraph ID 115 and 151 provide details about the accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement. The company entered into an ASR agreement on May 8, 2023, and received an initial delivery of 1.8 million shares. In August 2023, an additional 0.3 million shares were received.\n\n4. **Borrowing from Senior Credit Facility**:\n   - Paragraph ID 151 mentions that the ASR was funded through borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility. Additionally, Paragraph ID 203 provides details on cash flows from financing activities, showing proceeds from the revolving credit facility of $815.0 million in 2023.\n\n5. **Increase of Senior Credit Facility to $750 million**:\n   - There is no direct mention in the provided paragraphs that the Senior Credit Facility was increased to $750 million.

The statement claims a significant decrease in total revenue by $165 million or 24%, with a major reduction in nutrition-related revenue and partner compensation.\n\n2. **Analyze the Document:**\n   - **Total Revenue Decrease:**\n     - According to paragraph 258, the total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $527.1 million, a 24% decrease from $692.2 million in 2022. The dollar amount decrease is indeed $165.1 million.\n     - Therefore, the statement regarding the total revenue decrease is supported by the document.\n\n   - **Nutrition-Related Revenue Decrease:**\n     - According to paragraph 258, the nutrition and other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $249.5 million, a 29% decrease from $353.3 million in 2022.\n     - The statement correctly identifies a major reduction in nutrition-related revenue.\n\n   - **Partner Compensation:**\n     - The statement mentions a reduction in partner compensation from 25% to 20%. However, the document itself does not provide explicit percentages of partner compensation relative to total revenue for direct comparison. It does mention in paragraph 259 that fees from Partners decreased by $4.4 million due to a 28% decrease in the number of Partners.\n     - The statement implying a reduction in partner compensation to 20% needs more context, as the document does not provide the necessary percentages to verify this part of the claim directly.\n\n3. **Document Each Step of the Reasoning Process:**\n   - The document confirms the total revenue decrease of $165 million or 24%.\n   - The document confirms a major reduction in nutrition-related revenue (29% decrease).\n   - The document does not provide direct percentages of partner compensation relative to revenue to confirm the exact figures cited in the statement.\n\n4. **Conclude with Final Determination:**\n   Although the document supports the overall decrease in total revenue and the major reduction in nutrition-related revenue, it does not explicitly quantify partner compensation percentages as stated. Therefore, the statement is partially supported but not fully confirmed.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted due to the lack of direct evidence regarding the exact partner compensation percentages."

The relevant paragraphs for this analysis are paragraphs [20], [155], [181], and [141].\n\n#### Relevant Data Points:\n- **Wholesale Customers:**\n  - U.S.: Over 1,850 wholesale customers (Paragraph [20])\n  - Canada: Nearly 550 wholesale customers (Paragraph [26])\n  - Note: Information on LAAP (Latin America and Asia Pacific) wholesale customers is not explicitly mentioned.\n\n- **Inventory Management:**\n  - Decrease in inventory provisions to $23.3 million from $29.4 million (Paragraph [181])\n  - Use of outlet stores and temporary clearance locations to clear excess merchandise (Paragraph [181])\n\n- **Sales and Operational Data:**\n  - Global net sales increased driven by international sales growth (Paragraph [141])\n  - U.S. net sales decreased due to decreased wholesale shipments and lower DTC consumer demand (Paragraph [155])\n  - Inventory reduction efforts mentioned (Paragraph [181]) but no explicit mention of strategic reduction in Spring and Fall purchases.\n\n### Step 3: Document the Reasoning Process\nLet's break down the statement:\n\n1. **\"In 2023, Columbia Sportswear's inventory balance decreased significantly\"**:\n   - The document mentions a decrease in inventory provisions from $29.4 million to $23.3 million (Paragraph [181]), indicating a reduction in inventory.\n\n2. **\"due to a strategic reduction in inventory purchases for the Spring and Fall seasons\"**:\n   - There is no direct mention of a strategic reduction in inventory purchases for Spring and Fall seasons. The document attributes the inventory reduction primarily to the use of outlet stores and temporary clearance locations.\n\n3. **\"and the use of outlet stores and temporary clearance locations to clear excess merchandise\"**:\n   - This part is supported by Paragraph [181], which states that excess inventory was reduced using outlet stores and temporary clearance locations.\n\n4. **\"while maintaining a robust wholesale customer base with 1,850 customers in the U.S. and nearly 350 in LAAP\"**:\n   - The document mentions over 1,850 wholesale customers in the U.S. (Paragraph [20]) and nearly 550 wholesale customers in Canada (Paragraph [26]). However, it does not provide the number of wholesale customers in the LAAP region.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude the Analysis\nThe statement incorrectly attributes the inventory decrease to a strategic reduction in purchases for Spring and Fall seasons, which is not supported by the document. Additionally, the document does not provide data on wholesale customers in the LAAP region.\n\n### Final Determination\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

A small discrepancy exists ($581,000 vs. $581,148), but this is minor and likely due to rounding or typographical error.\n\n   - **Deferred Compensation**:\n     - The document does not explicitly mention deferring compensation for the executive management team to mitigate cash deficiencies.\n     - Paragraphs related to compensation are [paragraph id = 44] and [paragraph id = 144], but they only discuss stock-based compensation expense without mentioning deferral.\n\n3. **Reasoning**:\n   - The financial document explicitly states a derivative loss of $581,000 (or $581,148 as in the statement with a minor discrepancy).\n   - There is no mention of deferring compensation for the executive management team to mitigate cash deficiencies.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - While the derivative loss part of the statement is aligned with the document, the part about deferring compensation for the executive management team to mitigate cash deficiencies is not mentioned or supported by the financial document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

            " To verify the statement, we need to examine the specific figures related to stock-based liabilities, stock options outstanding, their aggregate intrinsic value, and the amount owed to Mikah Pharma LLC as an accrued expense.\n\n### Step 1: Examine Stock-Based Liabilities\nFrom the financial document, specifically in Note 4 (Accrued Expenses), we can see the following:\n- Salaries and fees payable in Common Stock inclusive of the change in fair value of Common stock underlying such liabilities: $6,934,812 (as of December 31, 2023).\n\n### Step 2: Examine Stock Options Outstanding\nNext, let's check the stock options outstanding. Unfortunately, the document does not explicitly state the number of stock options outstanding on December 31, 2023. However, it mentions the granting of options:\n- On September 19, 2023, options were granted to an employee for 1,000,000 shares.\n\nTo confirm the total number of stock options outstanding, we would typically need information regarding all issued stock options and any exercises or cancellations during the period.\n\n### Step 3: Examine Aggregate Intrinsic Value of Stock Options\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of stock options is also not explicitly provided. The information given is related to the fair value of options granted (e.g., $0.0819 per share for 1,000,000 shares), but this does not directly give us the intrinsic value on December 31, 2023.\n\n### Step 4: Examine Accrued Expense Owed to Mikah Pharma LLC\nFrom Note 4 (Accrued Expenses), we can see the following:\n- Co-development profit split: $3,389,949 (as of December 31, 2023).\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the provided financial document:\n- The balance of $6,934,812 in stock-based liabilities is confirmed.\n- The explicit number of stock options outstanding and their aggregate intrinsic value is not directly confirmed by the document.\n- The amount owed to Mikah Pharma LLC as an accrued expense ($3,389,949) is confirmed.\n\nTherefore, while certain parts of the statement are verified (stock-based liabilities and accrued expense to Mikah Pharma LLC), the information regarding stock options outstanding and their aggregate intrinsic value cannot be conclusively confirmed based on the provided document.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

These losses were partially offset by interest earned on investments held in the Trust Account of $4,360,578 and forgiveness of deferred underwriting fees of $348,344.\n\n2. **High Non-Redemption Agreement Expenses:**\n    - The expense related to non-redemption agreements is specifically mentioned to be $8,614,541 (paragraph 49).

This implies these businesses were likely being prepared for sale in 2022, but the actual sale (and likely any workforce reductions associated) happened in 2023.\n\n### Analysis of Each Component:\n1. **Acquisitions totaling $43.1 million in 2023**:\n   - The document explicitly mentions the acquisitions totaling $43.1 million in 2023, with $23.0 million for SEMTH and $20.1 million for Tredegar.\n\n2. **Impacting cash flows**:\n   - The document clearly mentions the specific cash flow impact in paragraph [132].\n\n3. **Discontinuing certain businesses in 2022 as part of a strategic restructuring**:\n   - The document states that the sale of legacy operations was completed in January 2023. There is no direct mention of workforce reductions and closures specifically in 2022. The restructuring, from the timeline provided, appears to have happened in 2023, not in 2022.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe document explicitly confirms the acquisition figures and their impact on cash flows in 2023. However, it contradicts the timing of the discontinuation of businesses and strategic restructuring, which is stated to have occurred in 2023, not 2022.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants... We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any, divided by the number of then-outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein.\"\n\nThis indicates that the company plans to redeem public shares at a price based on the Trust Account balance upon completion of the initial business combination.\n\n#### Shareholder Approval and Transaction Timing\nParagraph 32 states:\n> \"If we are unable to complete an initial Business Combination by June 17, 2025 we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders\u2019 rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.\"\n\nThis confirms the company\u2019s intentions regarding shareholder approval and managing transaction timing.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Statement\nThe statement claims that the company plans to complete its initial business combination using cash, equity, or debt, while also considering redeeming public shares for $10.10 per share from the Trust Account, and addressing shareholder approval to manage transaction timing and costs.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n- The company intends to use cash, equity, or debt for the initial business combination.\n- The redemption price of public shares is based on the Trust Account balance, initially anticipated to be $10.10 per public share.\n- The company plans to manage transaction timing and costs through shareholder approval and redemption processes.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe statement is supported by the provided financial document.

            " 1. **Net Sales Analysis:**\n   - According to [paragraph id = 154], \"Net sales in the first quarter of 2024 were $6.0 billion, as compared to $5.8 billion in the first quarter of 2023, an increase of $149 million or 3%.\"\n   - This confirms that Lear Corporation achieved net sales of $6.0 billion and experienced a 3% net sales increase.\n\n2. **Reason for Net Sales Increase:**\n   - The same paragraph states, \"New business in every region and our acquisition of I.G. Bauerhin ('IGB') favorably impacted net sales by $114 million and $51 million, respectively.\"\n   - This confirms that the increase was due to new business and acquisitions.\n\n3. **Gross Profit Margin Analysis:**\n   - According to [paragraph id = 153], the gross profit for the first quarter of 2024 was $398.1 million, and the net sales were $5,994.6 million.\n   - To calculate the gross profit margin, we use the formula: (Gross Profit / Net Sales) * 100%.\n   - Plugging in the values, we get: ($398.1 million / $5,994.6 million) * 100% = 6.6%.\n   - This confirms that the gross profit margin was 6.6%.\n\n4. **Restructuring Costs Analysis:**\n   - From [paragraph id = 167] and [paragraph id = 170], we see restructuring costs mentioned for Seating and E-Systems segments.\n   - For Seating: \"Higher restructuring costs... negatively impacted segment earnings by $53 million.\"\n   - For E-Systems: \"...higher restructuring costs...\" (no specific amount mentioned).\n   - However, there is no explicit mention of a total value of $54 million for restructuring costs. The statement seems to conflate the restructuring costs with the segment earnings for E-Systems, which were $54 million.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- The net sales figure, the reason for the net sales increase, and the gross profit margin are accurate.\n- The statement about recognizing restructuring costs of $54 million is not explicitly supported by the provided document.\n\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, the statement is refuted."

We will proceed under the assumption that this data might be correct for our next steps.\n\n   - **Net Operating Loss (NOL) Carryforwards**:\n     - The document states (paragraph id = 279): \"As of December 31, 2023, the Company had U.S. net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) of $192.9 million.\"\n     - Additionally, it mentions limitations under Section 382 with annual allowance specifics.\n\n3. **Assess Section 382 Limitations**:\n   - **Section 382 Limitation**:\n     - \"the Company\u2019s ability to use NOLs to reduce taxable income is generally limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to an annual amount, of $3.5 million plus an uplift of $24.5 million.\"\n   - This confirms the constraints under Section 382 due to an ownership change.\n\n4. **Consolidate Findings**:\n   - We have verified that Flotek holds $192.9 million in NOL carryforwards.\n   - The document confirms the limitations under Section 382, allowing an annual utilization of $3.5 million plus an uplift of $24.5 million.\n   - The statement about $48.0 million in cumulative losses over three years is not directly substantiated within the provided data, but for the purposes of this entailment/refutal, it is not contradicted if we consider the given figure as part of assumed past figures not shown.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

Obligation to operate businesses in the ordinary course:\n- **Paragraph [id = 12]**: \"the Parties agreed to be bound by certain covenants...including obligations of the Parties to use their best efforts to operate their respective businesses in the ordinary course.\"\n  - This matches the statement requirement.\n\n#### 2. Not engage in competing transactions prior to Closing:\n- **Paragraph [id = 12]**: \"Additionally, the Parties have agreed not to solicit, negotiate, or enter into a competing transaction.\"\n  - This matches the statement requirement.\n\n#### 3. Covenants and representations generally not surviving the Closing except for certain exceptions:\n- **Paragraph [id = 12]**: \"The covenants of the Parties generally will not survive the Closing, subject to certain exceptions, including certain covenants and agreements that by their terms are to be performed in whole or in part after the Closing.\"\n  - This matches the statement requirement.\n\n#### 4. Purchaser holds at least $5,000,001 in tangible net assets upon Closing:\n- **Paragraph [id = 13]**: \"the Purchaser having at least $5,000,001 in tangible net assets upon the Closing.\"\n  - This matches the statement requirement.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAll components of the given statement are supported by specific details in the provided financial document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Ownership changes and IRC Section 382:**\n   - The document (paragraph id = 424) mentions that the Company has undergone multiple ownership changes as defined by IRC Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, in December 2017, February 2018, and May 2021. This confirms the ownership changes part of the statement.\n\n2. **Net operating loss carryforwards and limitation:**\n   - The document (paragraph id = 419) shows deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards of $25,351 as of December 31, 2023. However, it does not explicitly state the amount subjected to limitation or the total amount of US federal net operating loss carryforwards. The statement mentions $3,858 being subjected to limitation out of $79,737 total, but we cannot confirm these numbers from the given document.\n\n3. **Net loss:**\n   - The Consolidated Statements of Operations (paragraph id = 317) show a net loss of $56,076 for the year ended December 31, 2023. This confirms the net loss part of the statement.\n\n4. **Potentially dilutive securities:**\n   - The document does not provide information about the total potentially dilutive securities at the end of 2023. It only mentions the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for basic and diluted loss per common share (paragraph id = 317), which is 73,524,476 for both basic and diluted. Without information on stock options, warrants, or other dilutive securities, we cannot confirm this part of the statement.\n\nBased on the analysis above, while some parts of the statement can be confirmed, others cannot be confirmed or refuted due to insufficient information in the provided document.\n\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, the statement is neither fully entailed nor fully refuted based on the given financial document.

We need to check the financial statements or related notes for this information.\n- Paragraphs discussing financial figures do not include specifics on additional paid-in capital.\n\n### Claim 3: Integration of QBT Operations into ERP System\n- Paragraph [id = 4] mentions the acquisition of Qorvo Biotechnologies, now renamed Zomedica Biotechnologies, LLC, on November 13, 2023.\n- There is no explicit mention of integrating Qorvo Biotechnologies\u2019 operations into an ERP system or addressing any material weakness in internal controls related to this integration.\n\n### Analysis and Conclusion\n- **Net Loss of $34,529 for 2023**: The document does not provide a net loss figure for 2023.

It specifically mentions that the Eco-Pan business (concrete waste management) operates from a shared Camfaud location.\n\n2. **Revenue Recognition for Concrete Waste Services:**\n   - From Paragraph 194: The Company generates revenue primarily from concrete pumping services and concrete waste services. It notes that these services are discussed further below.\n   - From Paragraph 195: The adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (ASC 842) is mentioned, with specific details about how revenue for the daily pan rental fee for the concrete waste services business is accounted for under ASC 842, and all other revenue is recorded under ASC 606.\n   - From Paragraph 198: It provides details about how revenue from concrete waste services is recognized. It mentions that there are two performance obligations\u2014daily usage of the pans or containers, and pickup and disposal of waste material. Revenue for daily usage fees is recognized under ASC 842, while disposal services are recognized under ASC 606.\n\n3. **Detailed Revenue Figures:**\n   - From Paragraph 316 (table): The table provides revenue figures for different segments, including U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services and U.K. Operations. However, it does not break down the revenue for concrete waste services in the U.K. specifically under ASC 606 or ASC 842.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The document states that the Eco-Pan business in the U.K. operates from a shared Camfaud location.\n- The document also explains that revenue from concrete waste services is recognized under both ASC 606 and ASC 842, with ASC 842 being used for the daily usage fees and ASC 606 for disposal services.\n- However, the document does not provide specific revenue figures for the U.K. concrete waste services under ASC 606 or ASC 842, nor does it claim that ASC 606 services are the main component of the fiscal year revenue ending October 31, 2023.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted as it specifies that ASC 606 services are the main component, which is not substantiated by the provided financial document.

The percentage decrease in net loss is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage Decrease} = \\left( \\frac{(277,976 - 91,961)}{91,961} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 202\\%\n     \\]\n   - This matches the information provided in the statement.\n\n2. **Goodwill impairment charge of $198.8 million**:\n   - The document explicitly mentions a goodwill impairment charge of $198.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 (paragraph id = 68).\n   - This confirms the information provided in the statement.\n\n3. **Total operating expenses increased by 136%**:\n   - The document states that total operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2023, were $301,146 thousand, compared to $127,851 thousand for the same period in 2022.

However, it incorrectly attributes the primary cause of the increase in total operating expenses to restructuring and other charges. The major contributor was the goodwill impairment charge.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed** regarding the net loss decrease, the goodwill impairment charge, and the percentage increase in operating expenses, but **refuted** regarding the primary cause of the increase in total operating expenses. Given the predominant error, the final determination is:\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

Whether there were no changes in internal controls during the recent quarter and no off-balance sheet arrangements impacting financial condition.\n\nLet's analyze each point with reference to the document:\n\n### 1. Material Weaknesses in Internal Control as of January 31, 2024\nThe statement says that Skkynet's management identified material weaknesses in internal control as of January 31, 2024. To verify this, we look at the relevant section of the document discussing internal controls:\n\nParagraph id = 43 states:\n> \"Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2024 using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework- 2013. Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that there are material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We lack full-time personnel in accounting and financial staff to sufficiently monitor and process financial transactions in an efficient and timely manner.\"\n\nThis confirms that management identified material weaknesses in internal control as of January 31, 2024.\n\n### 2. No Changes in Internal Controls and No Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe statement also claims that there were no changes in internal controls during the recent quarter and no off-balance sheet arrangements impacting financial condition. To verify this, we need to find the sections addressing changes in internal controls and off-balance sheet arrangements:\n\n#### Changes in Internal Controls\nParagraph id = 44 states:\n> \"There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our most recent quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\"\n\nThis confirms that there were no changes in internal controls during the recent quarter.\n\n#### Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThere is no specific mention of off-balance sheet arrangements in the provided sections of the document. However, the absence of such information typically implies there were no such arrangements, given that financial statements are required to disclose significant financial conditions or risks.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth points of the statement are supported by the provided financial document. Therefore, the statement is:\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

It highlights that Niger is a significant supplier of uranium and that the Junta has threatened the export of uranium to France.\n   - **Uncertainty in Securing Additional Capital**:\n     - Paragraphs 56, 59, 61, 66, 67, and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements discuss the financial risks and challenges Western faces. These include the need for additional capital to continue operations, the sensitivity of their operations to uranium and vanadium prices, and the potential risks to their long-term success if they cannot secure additional financing or maintain profitability.\n\n3. **Document Each Step of the Reasoning Process**:\n   - **Geopolitical Instability**: The instability in Niger, as described in paragraph 36, clearly poses a risk to uranium supply. France, which relies significantly on uranium from Niger, is already seeking alternative sources, indicating the seriousness of this risk.\n   - **Capital Securing Uncertainty**: Paragraphs 56 and 59 explicitly mention that Western's ability to continue operations depends on securing additional capital. Note 2 further emphasizes the risk, stating that there is substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n4. **Conclude the Analysis**:\n   - Both aspects mentioned in the statement\u2014geopolitical instability affecting uranium supply from Niger and the uncertainty in securing additional capital for ongoing operations\u2014are supported by the provided document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

            " ### Step 1: Carefully read the given context and the statement\n\nFirst, we need to review the provided financial document and the statement to be verified:\n\n- **Statement to verify**: In 2023, Blackboxstocks faced increased competition with similar product features and price points from companies like Trade Ideas and faced challenges in its financial condition due to reduced revenues and operational losses, despite their efforts to reduce advertising and development costs.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the document, focusing on the relevant financial data or facts that relate to the statement\n\nWe need to look for information in the document that relates to competition, financial condition, revenues, operational losses, and advertising and development costs.\n\n#### Relevant Sections from the Document:\n\n- **Competition** (Paragraph ID = 41):\n  - \"We operate in a highly competitive environment. Although, we believe that our Blackbox System is the only platform that has successfully merged a comprehensive analytics system or 'scanner' and a social media platform within the same 'dashboard' allowing members to view the same real-time data in parallel, there are a number of companies that offer one or more features that are similar to or attempt to address the same market as we do. Some of these competitors have financial and other resources that are significantly greater than ours.\"\n  - \"The greatest amount of competition exists within products that provide trading analytics often referred to as 'scanners'.\"\n\n- **Advertising and Marketing Expense** (Paragraph ID = 34):\n  - \"Our advertising and marketing expense was $629,984 and $1,468,702 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We significantly reduced the amount of our digital marketing spend during 2023 as part of an overall expense reduction as well as a review of the effectiveness of certain marketing strategies.\"\n\n### Step 3: Document each step of your reasoning process\n\n1. **Competition**:\n   - The document mentions that Blackboxstocks operates in a highly competitive environment and that some competitors offer similar features. However, it does not specifically name Trade Ideas or provide details on increased competition with similar price points in 2023.\n\n2. **Financial Condition**:\n   - The document does not explicitly discuss reduced revenues or operational losses for 2023.\n\n3. **Advertising and Development Costs**:\n   - The document indicates that Blackboxstocks significantly reduced its digital marketing spend in 2023, but it does not mention development costs.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude your analysis with a final determination\n\nBased on the information provided in the document:\n\n- The document acknowledges competition but does not specify increased competition from companies like Trade Ideas with similar product features and price points in 2023.\n- The document does not mention reduced revenues or operational losses, which are critical components of the statement.\n- The document mentions a reduction in advertising costs but does not discuss development costs.\n\nTherefore, the statement cannot be supported by the information provided in the document.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

            " To verify the given statement, we need to analyze relevant sections of the financial document to confirm two main points:\n1. Denali Capital Acquisition Corp's management faced potential conflicts of interest due to ownership of founder shares.\n2. The redemption rights for public shareholders include a restriction on redeeming more than 15% of shares sold in the IPO.\n\nLet's examine the document paragraph by paragraph to find relevant information:\n\n1. **Conflicts of Interest due to Ownership of Founder Shares:**\n\n   Paragraph [22] discusses conflicts of interest:\n   \"Members of our management team and board of directors may, directly or indirectly, own founder shares and/or Private Placement Units and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination.\"\n\n   This confirms that the management and board of directors may have conflicts of interest due to the ownership of founder shares.\n\n2. **Restrictions on Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders:**\n\n   Paragraph [26] discusses the restriction on redemptions:\n   \"If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the IPO, which we refer to as \u201cExcess Shares,\u201d without our prior consent.\"\n\n   This confirms that there is a restriction on public shareholders redeeming more than 15% of the shares sold in the IPO.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis of paragraphs [22] and [26], the document supports both points mentioned in the statement. The management does face potential conflicts of interest due to the ownership of founder shares, and there is a restriction on redeeming more than 15% of shares sold in the IPO.\n\nTherefore, the statement is entailed."

The impact of future regulatory requirements on operations or the resale value or useful lives of its vessels may result in substantial additional costs in meeting new legal and regulatory requirements.\"\n   - Additionally, paragraph 68 states: \"These costs, delays, expenses and off-hire time could have a material adverse effect on OSG\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\"\n   - This confirms that OSG faces potential financial impacts from new regulatory requirements.\n\n3. **Increased Competition Due to Potential Changes in the Jones Act**:\n   - There is no mention of the Jones Act or increased competition in the provided document.\n   - The document discusses various regulatory requirements and potential financial impacts, but it does not specifically address the Jones Act or changes therein that could lead to increased competition.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe document supports the parts of the statement regarding OSG's robust safety and environmental standards and potential financial impacts from new regulatory requirements. However, it does not provide any information about potential changes in the Jones Act or increased competition related to such changes.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** due to the lack of information about the Jones Act and increased competition in the provided document."

The number of treasury shares redeemed due to termination agreements in 2023 and 2022.\n\n**Step 1: Verifying the company's loss amounts for 2023 and 2022.**\n- For the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the company recorded losses of $2,817,340 and $1,656,019, respectively (paragraph id = 30).\n\n**Step 2: Calculating the increase in loss.**\n- The increase in loss is calculated as $2,817,340 (2023) - $1,656,019 (2022) = $1,161,321.\n- This increase was mainly associated with increases in professional services and bad debt expense in 2023, which aligns with the given statement.\n\n**Step 3: Verifying the number of treasury shares redeemed in 2023.**\n- On May 17, 2023, the company acquired 200,000 shares at a $0 cost (paragraph id = 14 and 91).\n- On July 5, 2023, the company acquired 450,000 shares at a cost of $45,000 (paragraph id = 14 and 91).\n- Additionally, on June 5, 2023, the company granted 530,000 shares at $0.15 per share (paragraph id = 96). However, these shares were issued for services rendered, not due to termination agreements. Therefore, they should not be included in the calculation for redeemed treasury shares due to non-performance.\n- The total number of shares redeemed due to termination agreements in 2023 is 200,000 + 450,000 = 650,000 shares.\n\n**Step 4: Verifying the number of treasury shares redeemed in 2022.**\n- The provided document does not mention any termination agreements or redeemed treasury shares for the year 2022. Therefore, the number of treasury shares redeemed in 2022 is 0.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The statement correctly mentions the loss amounts for 2023 and 2022.\n- However, the statement incorrectly states the number of redeemed treasury shares for both years. The document shows that the company redeemed 650,000 shares in 2023 and 0 shares in 2022 due to termination agreements.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

The decrease in recruitment activities was identified as a factor in the decline in revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2023.\n\nLet's analyze each point:\n\n1. **Primary Revenue Source**:\n   - From paragraph id 15, we have: \"Our revenue generated from Force Club Membership arrangements accounted for substantially all of our revenues during the three months ended December 31, 2023.\"\n\n2. **Premium Members Offerings**:\n   - In paragraph id 15, it states: \"Generally, the Company grants Force Club members the rights to access the Company\u2019s educational content.

Next, we calculate the percentage change:\n   - Percentage Change = (Change / Net cash provided by operating activities in 2022) * 100\n   - Percentage Change = (-$1,953,000 / $3,480,000) * 100\n   - Percentage Change = -56.12%\n\n5. The calculated percentage change (-56.12%) indicates a decrease, not an increase. Moreover, it does not match the claimed 143.62% increase.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

            " ### Analysis of the Financial Document\n\n#### Step 1: Identify Relevant Paragraphs\nParagraphs 17, 20, 22, 24, 66, and 105 contain relevant financial data pertaining to the trust account and potential redemption amount per share.\n\n#### Step 2: Examine the Trust Account Value\nFrom paragraph 66 (under \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\"):\n- As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the investments held in the Trust Account was $72,731,536.\n\n#### Step 3: Calculate Redemption Value Per Share\nFrom paragraph 17:\n- The document outlines the procedure upon liquidation:\n  - Public shares will be redeemed at a value equivalent to the aggregate amount in the trust account (including interest and net of taxes) divided by the number of outstanding public shares.\n\nFrom paragraph 66:\n- The number of outstanding shares after various redemptions and extensions is 7,665,386.\n\nCalculation:\n```plaintext\nTrust Account Value / Outstanding Shares = $72,731,536 / 7,665,386 = $9.49 per share\n```\n\n#### Step 4: Consider Additional Liabilities\nFrom paragraph 24:\n- Reedemption amounts may be reduced by claims from creditors.\n- The per-share redemption amount received may be less than $10.10 if the funds in the trust account are reduced by claims from third parties.\n\nParagraph 24 also states:\n> \"the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of our stockholders and the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced.\"\n\n#### Step 5: Legal and Other Fees\nWhile the document does not specify the exact legal and other fees, the possibility of additional expenses is mentioned. Given these contingencies, the redemption value per share could be less than the calculated $9.49.\n\n#### Step 6: Compare to Statement to Verify\nThe statement to verify:\n> \"The redemption amount per share upon liquidation could be as low as $9.29, considering attorney fees and other liabilities, despite the current trust value per share of $11.01 as of December 31, 2023.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n- Keeping in mind the potential for attorney fees and other liabilities, reducing the current $9.49 per share value to $9.29 is plausible.\n- Considering the net value of the trust account is given as $72,731,536, rather than $11.01 per share as stated in the document, the statement to verify seems to overestimate the initial value but correctly estimates the reduction due to potential liabilities.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

However, the document also mentions that $23,333,336 was available in the trust account as of April 1, 2024.\n   - To verify the approximate value per share upon liquidation, divide the trust amount by the number of outstanding shares:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\$23,333,336}{1,915,386 \\text{ shares}} \\approx \\$12.17 \\text{ per share}\n     \\]\n   - Taking into consideration other potential deductions, less than $11.01 per share upon liquidation may be a reasonable estimate if combined deductions are substantial.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWe have calculated net tangible assets to be $7,233,336 before the initial business combination, which is indeed more than $5 million. The document also confirms that a potential liquidation amount could be approximately $12.17 per share, adjusting for possible deductions could reasonably fall below $11.01 if certain legal or other liabilities reduce the trust amount significantly.\n\nThus, based on the financial data provided:\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

However, to calculate the interest savings, we would need to know the variable SOFR rate that the corporation would have paid without the swap.\n- Without the variable SOFR rate, we cannot calculate the exact interest savings.\n- The document mentions the fair value of the swap liability but does not provide the direct savings from the swap.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude the analysis.\n\nBased on the provided financial document, there is no direct mention of interest savings amounting to $2.3 million annually from the interest rate swap. The document does not provide the necessary variable SOFR rate to calculate such savings accurately. Additionally, no passage explicitly states that the savings are $2.3 million annually.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

For this to be true, the dividend received must equal 8% of the initial investment.\n\n4. **Investigation**:\n   - The document does not provide any information about the specific investment value made in July 2023.\n   - Additionally, paragraph 88 indicates that the Series A Preferred Stock was converted into Common Stock prior to September 29, 2023, which implies that the stockholders might not hold the Series A Preferred Stock throughout the entire year.\n   - Therefore, without knowing the investment value made in July 2023 or the duration for which the Series A Preferred Stock was held, it is impossible to confirm the effective dividend yield.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the information provided in the document, it is not possible to verify the statement's claim about the effective dividend yield for the Series A Preferred Stock held throughout 2023. The document lacks critical information such as the initial investment value made in July 2023 and the actual duration for which the stock was held.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

For the nine-month period ended November 30, 2023, the net loss was $15,995 (paragraph id = 129).\n   - This aligns with the statement that the company is operating at a net loss.\n\n2. **Reliance on Equity Financing**:\n   - The document mentions that the Company has financed its operations and commercialization plans primarily by raising equity (paragraph id = 11). It also mentions that the Company has been successful in raising capital to finance its ongoing operations (paragraph id = 130).\n   - This aligns with the statement that the company heavily relies on equity financing.\n\n3. **Prepared Financial Statements on a Going Concern Basis**:\n   - The document confirms that the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis (paragraph id = 11). Management believes that the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of operations for at least twelve months from the date of issuance of the financial statements (paragraph id = 131).\n   - This aligns with the statement that the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.\n\n4. **Substantial Decrease in Operating Expenses**:\n   - The document shows a decrease in operating expenses. For the three-month period ended November 30, 2023, there is a noted decrease in research and development expenses ($2,749) and general and administrative expenses ($725) (paragraph id = 12). For the nine-month period ended November 30, 2023, there is a decrease in general and administrative expenses ($10,463) and research and development expenses ($6,772) (paragraph id = 129).\n   - This aligns with the statement that there has been a substantial decrease in operating expenses.\n\n5. **Optimize Capital Structure and Support Future Expansion**:\n   - The document discusses the Company's plans to continue raising capital to finance the start-up of commercial operations and ongoing operations, including expansions into global markets (paragraph id = 132).\n   - This aligns with the statement that the company is leveraging decreased expenses to optimize its capital structure and support future expansion plans.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe provided statement accurately reflects the information presented in the financial document.

Given that the statement refers to operating cash flow challenges, we need to infer it from other indicators like sales, expenses, and net income.\n\n### Step 3: Check Interest Expense\n**Interest expense, net for 2023**: From the Consolidated Statements of Operations\n- Interest expense, net: \\(-\\$ 9\\) million\n\n### Step 4: Check Impairment Charges\n**Impairment and other for 2023**: From paragraph id 253\n- \"Impairment charges of $30 million from a review of underperforming stores and accelerated tenancy charges on right-of-use assets for closures of the Sidestep banner, certain Foot Locker Asia stores, and our U.S. atmos stores.\"\n- \"intangible asset impairment of $9 million on an atmos tradename\"\n- Summarizing the part relevant to \"impairment\":\n  - Total impairment charges: \\(30 \\text{ M} + 9 \\text{ M} = 39 \\text{ million} \\)\n\n### Step 5: Repurchase Capability\nThe document does not explicitly mention a $1.1 billion repurchase capability. However, it provides information on cash and cash equivalents:\n\n**Cash and cash equivalents for 2023**: \\$297 million\n\n### Step 6: Liquidity Indicators\nThere are no specific entries referring to a $478 million impairment charge on a minority investment but we have located general impairment charges which total \\(39\\) million.\n\n### Final Analysis:\n1. **Interest expense, net** for 2023 confirms the statement's figure: \\$9 million.\n2. **Impairment charges** for 2023 total \\$39 million, not \\$478 million as stated.\n3. There is no indication of a $1.1 billion repurchase capability in the provided document, only cash and cash equivalents listed at \\$297 million.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven these discrepancies:\n- **Interest Expense**: Correct\n- **Impairment Charges**: Incorrect (provided in document is \\$39 million instead of \\$478 million)\n- **Repurchase Capability**: Not found in the document\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

            " 1. **Reading the context and the statement**:\n   The provided financial document discusses various details about the Company's Third Amended Credit Agreement and its financial situation. The statement to verify speculates about the impact of the interest rate margin increase on the Company's debt-related expenses and its ability to comply with financial covenants.\n\n2. **Analyzing relevant financial data**:\n   - The Third Amended Credit Agreement increased the applicable interest rate margins for SOFR and base rate loans by 25 basis points ([paragraph id = 27] and [paragraph id = 60]).\n   - The Company had an increase in interest expense, net by 11.3% and 16.2% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2023, respectively, primarily due to higher interest rates ([paragraph id = 114]).\n   - The Company expects that a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately $0.3 and $0.6 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2023, respectively ([paragraph id = 130]).\n   - The Company saw an improvement in year-over-year gross margin in fiscal 2024 ([paragraph id = 57]).\n   - The Company was in compliance with its financial covenants as of December 31, 2023 ([paragraph id = 29]).\n\n3. **Reasoning process**:\n   - The increase in interest rate margins by 25 basis points is likely to raise the Company's debt-related expenses, as evident from the increased interest expense due to higher interest rates and the projected impact of a 50 basis point increase.\n   - However, the Company's compliance with financial covenants as of December 31, 2023, indicates that, despite the increase in interest expense, the Company was able to meet its financial obligations.\n   - The improvement in gross margin could mitigate the impact of increased debt-related expenses.\n\n4. **Final determination**:\n   While the increase in interest rate margins may raise debt-related expenses, the Company's covenant compliance and improved gross margin do not support the suggestion that it will challenge its ability to meet financial covenants. Therefore, the statement is refuted."

Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Working Capital Deficit:**\n   - Working capital is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities.\n   - As of December 31, 2023, the working capital is $109,197 (current assets) - $348,158 (current liabilities) = -$238,961 (working capital deficit).\n   - As of June 30, 2023, the working capital is $106,002 (current assets) - $219,899 (current liabilities) = -$113,179 (working capital deficit).\n   - The increase in working capital deficit from June to December 2023 is $238,961 - $113,179 = $125,782.\n\n2. **Cause of Increase in Working Capital Deficit:**\n   - The document states that the increase in working capital deficit is primarily related to long-term debt.\n   - From the balance sheet, we can see that the current portion of notes payable increased significantly from $6,930 in June 2023 to $127,029 in December 2023, contributing to the increase in current liabilities and thus the working capital deficit.\n\n3. **Cash Impacted by Currency Translation:**\n   - The document mentions that the change in cash is primarily due to currency translation.\n   - However, there's no direct evidence in the document to quantify the impact of currency translation on cash.\n\n4. **Cash Flow from Operating Activities:**\n   - Net cash provided by operating activities for the six-month period ending December 31, 2023, was $22,177, which is an increase compared to $18,744 in the same period of 2022.\n\n5. **Revenue Growth:**\n   - Revenues from operations for the six-month period ending December 31, 2023, were $21,134, an increase compared to $18,358 in the same period of 2022.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the statement is partly true. While the company did experience a substantial increase in working capital deficit due to long-term debt obligations and there was notable revenue growth and an increase in cash flow from operating activities, the poor working capital management is not explicitly demonstrated. The document attributes the working capital deficit increase to long-term debt and not necessarily poor management. Additionally, the impact of currency translation on cash is mentioned but not quantified.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

This situation notably constrains our ability to attractively raise funds through equity. The low share price and market cap may limit our appeal to investors and restrict our capacity to raise significant capital through the sale of equity without substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.\" This paragraph confirms that the company\u2019s ability to raise capital through equity is constrained.\n   - From **paragraph id = 66**: \"We do not have sufficient authorized shares of common stock available for issuance, which limits our ability to secure financing which may cause us to be unable to continue operations. ... If the stockholders do not approve such proposal at the Special Meeting, we will not have sufficient shares of common stock authorized available and unreserved, which would adversely impact our ability to pursue opportunities.\" This paragraph clearly states that the company lacks sufficient authorized shares, which hinders its ability to secure financing and pursue opportunities.\n   - From **paragraph id = 286**: \"Our plans to alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt include reduced spending, and the pursuit of additional capital. We have concluded the likelihood that our plan to successfully obtain sufficient funding from one or more of these sources, or adequately reduce expenditures, while possible, is less than probable.\" This further supports the uncertainty in obtaining additional capital and the substantial doubt about continuity.\n\n3. **Evaluate if the document supports or refutes the statement**:\n   - The document explicitly mentions the company's substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern due to insufficient authorized shares and the difficulty in securing additional capital.\n   - The inability to secure capital amplifies the risk of a liquidity crisis and limits the company's strategic and operational continuity, aligning with the statement's assertion.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The provided statement is consistent with the information presented in the financial document.

            " To verify the given statement, let's follow the steps outlined:\n\n### Step 1: Read the Context and the Statement\nWe have a detailed financial document describing the acquisition, operation, and ongoing activities of Artisan Consumer Goods, Inc., focusing on the Within / Without Granola (WWG) brand. The statement suggests that the company's ongoing search for a new manufacturer and the lack of sales in 2023 might necessitate an impairment test for the WWG trademark.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Document\n#### Key Points from the Document:\n- **Acquisition**: The company acquired the WWG brand on July 15, 2021, for $10,000.\n- **Manufacturing and Sales**: Manufacturing restarted in June 2022, and the first sales were generated in August 2022.\n- **Expired Inventory**: Inventory from the first run expired in February 2023, and the remaining inventory was written off.\n- **Search for a New Manufacturer**: The company is searching for a new manufacturer to produce smaller batches; as of February 19, 2024, a new manufacturer has not been engaged.\n- **Revenue**: The company had revenues of $-0- for the three and six months ended December 31, 2023.\n- **Intangible Assets**: The WWG trademark is deemed to have an indefinite life and will be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis.\n\n### Step 3: Document the Reasoning Process\n1. **Lack of Sales in 2023**: The document states that the company generated no revenues for the three and six months ended December 31, 2023. This indicates a lack of sales during this period.\n2. **Search for a New Manufacturer**: The company is actively searching for a new manufacturer and has not engaged one as of February 19, 2024. This situation could impact the company's ability to produce and sell products.\n3. **Impairment Test for Trademark**: The WWG trademark has an indefinite life and will be evaluated for impairment annually. Given the lack of sales and ongoing manufacturing issues, the value of the trademark could be questioned.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, the statement aligns with the information provided in the financial document. The ongoing search for a new manufacturer and the lack of sales in 2023 indeed suggest difficulties that could impact the company's ability to continue as a going concern. This, in turn, may necessitate an impairment test for the WWG trademark deemed to have an indefinite life.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

            " To assess the truthfulness of the given statement, we need to carefully analyze the financial document provided. Here are the steps to follow:\n\n1. **Read the Financial Document**: We need to look at the sections related to the company's financial performance, specifically focusing on the stock offering and the net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards.\n\n2. **Identified Relevant Sections**:\n   - **Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows**: This section provides information on the issuance of common stock.\n   - **Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements**: This section includes details on income taxes, including NOL carryforwards.\n\n3. **Analyze the Issuance of Common Stock in 2023**:\n   - According to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, under \"Cash flows from financing activities\", the company raised $38,490 thousand (or $38.5 million) through the issuance of common stock in 2023.\n\n4. **Net Operating Loss Carryforwards**:\n   - According to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2023, the company had net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $334 million for federal income tax purposes.\n\n5. **LImitations on the Use of NOL Carryforwards**:\n   - The notes also mention that the use of these carryforward amounts is subject to an annual limitation as a result of a previous ownership change and a tax ownership change that occurred in June 2021. This means there are restrictions on how much of the NOL carryforwards can be utilized each year.\n\n6. **Impact on Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Strategy**:\n   - The limitations imposed by the ownership change can indeed impact the company's ability to fully utilize the NOL carryforwards, which in turn could affect their deferred tax asset valuation strategy.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the provided financial document, the statement is supported by the data. The company did raise $38.5 million through a stock offering in 2023, and there are limitations on utilizing the $334 million federal NOL carryforwards due to the 2021 ownership change, which could impact their deferred tax asset valuation strategy.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

The relevant data is found in paragraphs 295 and 296.\n\n   - Paragraph 295 discusses the asset allocation:\n     - Targets for U.S. plans: 21% Growth Portfolio, 77% Immunizing Portfolio, 2% Liquidity Portfolio\n     - Actual allocations for U.S. plans at December 31, 2023: 20% Growth Portfolio, 78% Immunizing Portfolio, 2% Liquidity Portfolio\n\n   - Paragraph 296 provides the discount rates for U.S. pension benefit obligations:\n     - 2023: 5.12%\n     - 2021: 2.83%\n\n2. **Analyze the Data:**\n\n   - The Immunizing Portfolio, which consists of long duration U.S. Treasury strips, corporate bonds, and cash, indeed makes up the majority of the U.S. plans' asset allocation (77% targeted, 78% actual). This portfolio is designed to mitigate interest rate risks.\n\n   - The discount rate for U.S. pension benefit obligations increased from 2.83% in 2021 to 5.12% in 2023.\n\n3. **Assess the Statement:**\n\n   - The statement suggests that despite the heavy allocation to the Immunizing Portfolio, there was a significant increase in the discount rate, illustrating increased sensitivity to interest rate changes.\n\n   - However, the increase in discount rate does not necessarily illustrate \"increased sensitivity\" of the liabilities to interest rate changes. In fact, the high allocation to the Immunizing Portfolio is intended to mitigate such sensitivity. The increase in discount rate more likely reflects broader economic trends and changes in long-term interest rates, rather than increased sensitivity.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n\n   Therefore, the statement is refuted. The increase in discount rate does not illustrate increased sensitivity of the liabilities to interest rate changes, but rather reflects broader economic trends and long-term interest rate changes."

This represents an increase of $225,000 ($2,914,000 - $2,689,000) in dividends paid.\n\n4. **Impact on Liquidity**: While the statement suggests that the dividend policy demanding higher payouts impacted liquidity, we need to consider other factors as well. The document shows that besides the increase in dividends paid, there was a significant increase in the purchase of treasury stock ($5,000 in 2023 vs. $364,000 in 2024), which also impacts liquidity.\n\nConclusion:\nWhile it is true that there was an increase in dividends paid, the impact on liquidity cannot be attributed solely to the dividend policy. The significant increase in the purchase of treasury stock also played a substantial role in affecting liquidity. Therefore, the statement is not entirely accurate.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

It also states that such reimbursement is performed at cost with the affiliate realizing no profit on the transaction.\n     - Paragraph [paragraph id = 337] further details that an affiliate provides professional services in the area of income tax preparation and consulting. The Company also receives certain finance and accounting expertise from this affiliate as requested. Expenses related to these services comprise an agreed quarterly fee plus reimbursement of expenses, at cost, and are reported as selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A).\n   - **Transfer Pricing and Arm's Length Principles**:\n     - There is no explicit mention of transfer pricing or arm's length principles in the document, but reimbursing at cost suggests a form of cost-based transfer pricing, which is generally aligned with arm's length principles.\n   - **Effective Segment Reporting**:\n     - The document mentions that the Company has two reportable segments: chemicals and biofuels. The accounting policies of the segments are the same, and costs related to affiliate services are reported under SG&A (selling, general, and administrative expenses).\n\n3. **Document Reasoning Process**:\n   - The statement claims that reimbursement for affiliate services at cost suggests a strategic application of transfer pricing. This aligns with the document's mention of reimbursement at cost.\n   - The claim about compliance with arm's length principles to avoid tax penalties can be inferred since reimbursing at cost is a common practice to comply with these principles, although the document does not explicitly mention tax penalties.\n   - The segment reporting consolidating these costs under SG&A affects both chemical and biofuel segments' profitability, which is consistent with the document's description of how these costs are reported.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the analysis, the statement is supported by the information provided in the document. The document discusses reimbursement at cost for affiliate services, reporting these costs under SG&A, and the impact on segment profitability.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

            " To determine if the given statement is entailed or refuted by the provided financial document, we need to examine the relevant sections that discuss Kronos' cash flow management, the cyclicality of TiO2 demand and pricing, debt obligations, and the company's ability to adjust pricing strategies. Here is a detailed analysis:\n\n1. **Cyclicality of TiO2 Demand and Pricing:**\n   - **Paragraph 23**: \"Pricing within the global TiO2 industry over the long term is cyclical and changes in economic conditions worldwide can significantly impact Kronos\u2019 earnings and operating cash flows. Historically, the markets for many of Kronos\u2019 products have experienced alternating periods of increasing and decreasing demand. Relative changes in the selling prices for Kronos\u2019 products are one of the main factors that affect the level of its profitability.\"\n   - **Paragraph 25**: \"In periods of increasing demand, Kronos\u2019 selling prices and profit margins generally will tend to increase, while in periods of decreasing demand Kronos\u2019 selling prices and profit margins generally tend to decrease.\"\n\n   These points clearly indicate that Kronos faces cyclical demand and pricing for TiO2, which can significantly impact its earnings and cash flows.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Management and Debt Obligations:**\n   - **Paragraph 27**: \"Kronos\u2019 business may not generate cash flows from operating activities sufficient to enable it to pay its debts when they become due and to fund its other liquidity needs. As a result, Kronos may need to refinance all or a portion of its debt before maturity, as we have done in the past. Kronos may not be able to refinance any of its debt in a timely manner on favorable terms, if at all, in the current credit markets. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flows or to refinance its debt on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and impact its ability to pay a dividend to us.\"\n\n   This paragraph explicitly states that Kronos may face challenges in generating sufficient cash flows to meet its debt obligations and may need to refinance its debt.\n\n3. **Ability to Adjust Pricing Strategies:**\n   - **Paragraph 25**: \"In addition, pricing may affect customer inventory levels as customers may from time to time accelerate purchases of TiO2 in advance of anticipated price increases or defer purchases of TiO2 in advance of anticipated price decreases. Kronos\u2019 ability to further increase capacity without additional investment in greenfield or brownfield capacity may be limited and as a result, Kronos\u2019 profitability may become even more dependent upon the selling prices of its products.\"\n\n   This paragraph suggests that Kronos' ability to adjust pricing strategies is contingent on market conditions and may not always be effective in offsetting increased costs.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the financial document supports the statement that Kronos faces challenges in cash flow management due to the cyclicality of TiO2 demand and pricing. This cyclical market dependency can hinder Kronos' capability to adjust pricing strategies to offset increased costs, directly impacting their ability to meet debt obligations and finance strategic initiatives.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

            " ### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Sections of the Document:**\n   - We need to focus on sections that discuss material weaknesses and financial reporting control issues.\n\n2. **Examine Paragraph ID 52:**\n   ```\n   We identified a material weakness in our controls over accounting that occurred beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 through the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 relating to special provisions in the tax laws regarding a Bank\u2019s allowable tax bad debt deductions and related tax bad debt reserves as described below. Based upon that discovery, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a level that provides reasonable assurance as of the last day of the period covered by this report.\n   ```\n   This paragraph explicitly states that from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the second quarter of 2024, there was a material weakness in controls over accounting related to tax laws on bad debt deductions and reserves.\n\n3. **Examine Paragraph ID 53:**\n   ```\n   The material weakness in internal control over financial reporting resulted from the lack of controls which allowed for the Company to erroneously maintain a deferred tax liability, which it will not be required to recapture as management does not intend to redeem stock, make distributions or take other actions that would result in the recapture of this reserve. The Company erroneously applied the Section 585 reserve method, whereby it was allowed to, in 1996, change to the specific charge-off method (with no reserve) and recapture the thrift reserves in their entirety if it switched from a thrift charter to a commercial charter prior to 1996. This material weakness resulted in the correction of the material errors and restatement of prior financial statements as disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated audited financial statements contained in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 20, 2023.\n   ```\n   This paragraph details the nature of the material weakness, specifically the misapplication of Section 585 tax reserve methods, and the subsequent restatement of financial statements.\n\n4. **Examine Paragraph ID 54:**\n   ```\n   We have been and are actively engaged in the implementation of remediation efforts to address the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. These remediation efforts include a robust review of all current and previous income tax laws impacting the Company including the preparation of a detailed checklist governing income taxes for financial institutions. Management believes that the new procedures and controls will provide an appropriate remediation of the material weakness; however, the effectiveness of the controls have not been fully tested by management. The material weakness will be fully remediated when, in the opinion of management, the revised control processes have been operating for a sufficient period of time and independently validated by management.\n   ```\n   This paragraph discusses efforts to remediate the weakness, indicating that while initiatives are in place, the remediation has not been fully tested or validated yet.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The financial document explicitly states there was a material weakness in controls over accounting from the fourth quarter of 2021 through the second quarter of 2024 due to the misapplication of Section 585 tax reserve methods.\n- This material weakness affected the company's financial reporting standards compliance.\n- Despite board-approved controls, the document acknowledges persistent issues with compliance.\n\nTherefore, the statement is supported by the document.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n**\"Therefore, the statement is entailed.\"**"

The increase was driven by higher cash collections resulting from increased billings, partially offset by higher compensation expenses and other expenses.\n\n3. **Operating income and gross profit (Paragraph ID 164):**\n   - Higher revenues leading to increased gross profit and operating income are mentioned. Operating income was partially offset by higher income taxes, resulting in an increase in net income.\n\n4. **Specific segments (not directly mentioned in provided paragraphs):**\n   - The document does not explicitly mention segments like Forensic and Litigation Consulting (FLC) and Technology.

The relevant data is found in paragraphs 161 and 163.\n\n2. **Net impact of foreign currency fluctuations**: According to paragraph 161, the net impact of foreign currency fluctuations on other comprehensive income was $8,665 in the nine months ended December 31, 2023.\n\n3. **Use of foreign currency forward contracts**: Paragraph 163 states that Houlihan Lokey enters into transactions to hedge exposure to foreign currency fluctuations using derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2023, there was one outstanding foreign currency forward contract between the U.S. dollar and the pound sterling with an aggregate notional value of $2.0 million.\n\n4. **Assess the effectiveness of hedging**: To determine if the forward contracts were effective in hedging risks, we need to consider the net impact of currency fluctuations on comprehensive income. A small impact could indicate effective hedging. The net impact of $8,665 is relatively small compared to Houlihan Lokey's revenues and net income for the same period (revenues were $1,393,948 and net income was $199,224, as shown in paragraph 118).\n\n**Conclusion**: The small net impact of foreign currency fluctuations on comprehensive income suggests that Houlihan Lokey's use of foreign currency forward contracts was generally effective in hedging against the risks associated with international cash balances and receivables.

There could be legitimate reasons for these observations (e.g., the company's financial situation, personal choices of the executives).\n\n4. **Conclusion:** The statement is not directly supported by the information in the document. While it is true that there was no compensation paid and there are unexercised options, the document does not provide evidence of a lack of internal alignment between ethical governance and executive compensation.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

We will analyze the relevant portions of the financial document step by step:\n\n1. **RSU Allocation and Vesting Schedule for the CEO**:\n   - According to [paragraph id = 364], the CEO's compensation package includes the allocation of 5,500,000 RSUs.\n   - The vesting schedule for these RSUs is as follows:\n     - 500,000 RSUs vested on March 31, 2024.\n     - 3,000,000 RSUs vest ratably over a period of 24 months beginning April 2, 2024.\n     - The remaining 2,000,000 RSUs, along with cash bonuses, vest upon the achievement of certain milestones.\n\n2. **JVR Credit Line**:\n   - According to [paragraph id = 363], the Company entered into a credit agreement with JVR Holdings, providing a line of credit facility up to $60 million.\n   - The credit line is contingent on the Company formalizing a plan for a construction project to expand its facilities.\n\n3. **Relationship between RSU Vesting and JVR Credit Line**:\n   - The vesting schedule (24 months for 3,000,000 RSUs and milestones for the remaining RSUs) could align with the Company's plans for drawing down the JVR credit line for expansion projects.\n   - The CEO's incentive to achieve short-term operational goals (e.g., completing phases of the expansion project) aligns with drawing down the credit line to fund these projects.\n   - This structure suggests that the CEO's rewards are closely tied to operational financing maneuvers, as milestones achieved in these projects could trigger the vesting of additional RSUs and cash bonuses.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nBased on the given financial document, the allocation and vesting schedule of RSUs in the CEO's compensation package could indeed incentivize short-term operational goals aligned with drawdowns on the JVR credit line, reflecting a close integration of executive rewards with operational financing maneuvers.\n\nTherefore, the statement is entailed."

This confirms that the restatement included adjustments to interest income from Trust Accounts.\n\n3. **Deferred Underwriting Fee Liability**:\n   - To verify the deferred underwriting fee liability, we need to check any mentions of this fee throughout the document.\n   - **Paragraph ID 222**: This paragraph states, \"The Company paid an upfront underwriting discount of $805,000, equal to 1.4% of the gross offering proceeds to the underwriter at the closing of the Initial Public Offering, with an additional fee of $1,615,000 (the 'Deferred Underwriting Discount').\" This confirms the deferred underwriting fee liability is $1,615,000.\n   - **No other paragraphs indicate any changes to the deferred underwriting fee during the restatement periods**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe restatement of financial statements in 2023 included adjustments to interest income from Trust Accounts, and there is no indication that the deferred underwriting fee liability changed during this period.

Specifically, as of December 31, 2023, Mannatech had a valuation allowance of $10.3 million for deferred tax assets that did not meet the \u201cmore likely than not\u201d criteria.\n     - **[paragraph id = 238]:** Indicates that transfer pricing policies can impact the effective tax rate and require reserves, suggesting a link between any disputes and deferred tax assets.\n\n   - **Transfer Pricing:**\n     - **[paragraph id = 268]:** Details how transfer pricing policies govern the allocation of taxable income among tax jurisdictions, including a loss before income taxes of $1.1 million for the year ending December 31, 2023, with a loss in the U.S. and income outside the U.S.\n     - **[paragraph id = 269]:** Identifies transfer pricing as a critical audit matter, emphasizing the significance of these policies in financial reporting.\n     - **[paragraph id = 311]:** Notes that net income or loss before income tax for U.S. and foreign entities is influenced by transfer pricing policies and that these policies are crucial for determining taxable income among various jurisdictions.\n\n3. **Documenting the Reasoning Process:**\n\n   - Both deferred tax valuation allowances and transfer pricing policies are explicitly mentioned in multiple paragraphs.

            " To verify the given statement, we need to analyze the provided financial document and determine whether it supports the claim that Independence Contract Drilling, Inc. maintains effective internal controls and adheres to corporate governance codes. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Internal Controls:**\n   - The statement mentions that the company maintains effective internal controls. In paragraph [99], it is stated that \"Our management, under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023... management determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\"\n   - This indicates that the company has evaluated its internal controls and found them to be effective. However, it is also mentioned in the audit reports (paragraphs [63] and [64]) that the company is not required to have, nor were the auditors engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.\n\n2. **Corporate Governance Codes:**\n   - The statement also claims that the company adheres to corporate governance codes. In paragraph [101], it is mentioned that the company has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, a Code of Ethics for Senior Officers, and a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors. These codes are available on the company's website, and any waivers or amendments must be approved by the Board of Directors and promptly disclosed.\n   - Additionally, paragraph [12] discusses the company's commitment to corporate governance, including annual training for employees on the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and the maintenance of reporting mechanisms for potential violations.\n\n3. **Certification under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 302:**\n   - The statement mentions certifications from key executives under Section 302. In the Exhibit Index (paragraph [112]), Exhibit 32.1 is listed as the \"Certification of Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\" Although this refers to Section 906 rather than 302, both sections relate to corporate responsibility and certifications by senior management.\n\nBased on the provided document, the company does claim to maintain effective internal controls and adheres to corporate governance codes. However, it is important to note that the company's internal controls have not been audited by an independent registered public accounting firm.\n\n**Conclusion:** The statement is generally supported by the document, but it is important to acknowledge the lack of independent attestation of the company's internal controls. Therefore, the statement is **entailed**, but with a caveat regarding the lack of independent audit of internal controls."

Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Understand the Statement**:\n   - **Statement:** Creative Realities, Inc.'s fulfillment of the $1,254 Secured Promissory Note repayment in 2023 illustrates a strategic use of equity financing from the common stock offering, since the cash generated was $5,454, surpassing their repayments of long-term obligations.\n\n2. **Examine the Secured Promissory Note Repayment**:\n   - From paragraph id = 121:\n     - \"Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023, is primarily the result of a common stock offering completed in August 2023, generating cash of $5,454, net of offering expenses, offset by repayments made on the Consolidation Term Loan, Term Loan (2022), and Secured Promissory Note of $2,040, $2,000 and $1,254, respectively.\"\n   - This confirms that the company did make the $1,254 repayment on the Secured Promissory Note in 2023.\n\n3. **Verify the Equity Financing**:\n   - From paragraph id = 121:\n     - \"Cash generated from common stock offering: $5,454.\"\n   - From paragraph id = 138:\n     - \"Issuance of common stock, net: $5,454.\"\n   - This confirms the common stock offering generated $5,454 in cash.\n\n4. **Verify the Repayment Against Cash Generated**:\n   - Repayments made on various loans:\n     - Consolidation Term Loan: $2,040\n     - Term Loan (2022): $2,000\n     - Secured Promissory Note: $1,254\n   - Total repayments: $2,040 + $2,000 + $1,254 = $5,294\n\n5. **Compare the Cash Generated with Repayments**:\n   - Cash generated from common stock offering: $5,454\n   - Total loan repayments: $5,294\n   - Comparison: $5,454 (cash generated) > $5,294 (total repayments)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe statement accurately reflects that the cash generated from the common stock offering in 2023 ($5,454) exceeded the loan repayments, including the $1,254 Secured Promissory Note repayment. Thus, the statement is supported by the given financial document.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

Without hedging against currency fluctuations, the company exposes itself to potential financial instability due to exchange rate movements.\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

This reflects conservative financial practice within regulatory compliance.\n\n2. **Analyzing Relevant sections in the Document**:\n   - Paragraph 64 mentions the company operates in the drug testing industry and revenues decreased by 12%.\n   - Paragraph 88 discusses a full valuation allowance of $2.6 million against deferred tax assets due to a three-year cumulative loss position and other factors.\n   - Paragraph 125 notes that the company manages operations as one segment.\n   - Paragraph 135 provides detailed information about deferred tax assets, valuation allowance, and the consideration of a three-year cumulative loss position.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Claim in the Statement**:\n   - **Segment Reporting Constraints**: Paragraph 125 confirms the company operates as a single segment, negating any \"segment reporting constraints.\"\n   - **Full Valuation Allowance and Three-year Cumulative Loss**: Paragraph 88 confirms the company had a full valuation allowance of $2.6 million and considered a three-year cumulative loss position as part of the assessment.\n   - **Regulatory Compliance**: The financial statements are prepared under U.S. GAAP, ensuring regulatory compliance.\n\n4. **Documenting Each Step**:\n   - The document confirms the company operates as a single segment, not multiple segments (Paragraph 125).\n   - The document mentions a full valuation allowance due to a three-year cumulative loss position, confirming conservative financial practice (Paragraph 88 and 135).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   The statement is accurate regarding the full valuation allowance and the three-year cumulative loss position indicating conservative financial practice. However, it incorrectly cites \"segment reporting constraints\" as an influence, as the company manages itself as a single segment.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed** regarding conservative financial practice and the allowance due to the three-year cumulative loss position, but it includes an inaccuracy about \"segment reporting constraints.\""

This is higher than the $1,500.0 million as of December 31, 2023.

This indicates that the company is indeed subject to interest rate fluctuations, which could increase its interest burden.\n\n3. **Impact of Rising SOFR Rates:**\n   - The document mentions that for every increase of 25 basis points in SOFR above the Cap level, the company's annual interest expense will increase by an additional $1.6 million. This supports the idea that rising SOFR rates could exacerbate the interest burden.\n\n4. **Debt Servicing Ratio:**\n   - While the document does not explicitly mention the company's debt servicing ratio or its future challenges, the increase in borrowings and the potential for higher interest expenses due to rising SOFR rates imply a potential challenge in maintaining a favorable debt servicing ratio.\n\nGiven these points, the statement aligns with the facts presented in the document. The increase in Term Loan borrowings, the interest rate structure tied to SOFR, and the potential impact of rising SOFR rates on interest expenses all suggest that the company could face future challenges in maintaining a favorable debt servicing ratio.\n\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, the statement is **entailed**."

These items are included within Special charges on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income ([paragraph id = 15]).\n\n3. **Level 3 Fair Value Measurement**:\n   - The document explains the fair value measurement hierarchy, including Level 3, which involves prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement ([paragraph id = 18]).\n\n4. **Impact of Fair Value Measurement on Impairment Assessments**:\n   - However, the document does not explicitly mention how reliance on Level 3 fair value measurement influenced the impairment assessments for the retained assets of the Sunoptics business. There is no direct link stated between Level 3 fair value measurement and the specific impairments recorded.\n\nBased on the information provided, the document confirms the sale of the Sunoptics business, the pre-tax loss, and the subsequent asset impairments.

The shares would be identical to the private placement shares issued to our Sponsor.\" ([paragraph id = 82])\n\n2. **Impact on Founder Shares' Lock-up**:\n   - The statement mentions that this conversion could significantly affect founder shares' lock-up.\n   - The document discusses lock-up provisions:\n     > \"Also pursuant to the Amended and Restated Sponsor Agreement, the Sponsor (or an affiliated co-investor of the Sponsor) has agreed to, subject to the other terms and conditions included therein, immediately prior to Closing, purchase in a private placement up to 5,000,000 shares of Class A common stock at a purchase price of $10.00 per share.\" ([paragraph id = 47])\n   - It does not explicitly mention how the conversion of loans into shares would relate directly to the lock-up provisions.\n\n3. **Impact on Registration Rights**:\n   - The statement mentions that this conversion could affect the registration rights due to potential dilution and market price effects.\n   - The document discusses registration rights:\n     > \"Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, the company will agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) file with the SEC (at the company\u2019s sole cost and expense) a registration statement registering the resale of certain securities held by or issuable to the Reg Rights Holders within 30 business days after the Closing (the 'Resale Registration Statement') and (ii) cause the Resale Registration Statement to become effective as soon as reasonably practicable after the filing thereof.\" ([paragraph id = 47])\n   - And regarding conversion and dilution:\n     > \"The shares would be identical to the private placement shares issued to our Sponsor.\" ([paragraph id = 82])\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe document confirms that up to $1,500,000 of loans from AltC Sponsor may convert to shares post-business combination at $10.00 per share.

The goodwill impairment was primarily due to a sustained decline in market capitalization, which suggests the company\u2019s current market value had decreased significantly compared to its earlier assessments. This necessitated reevaluating asset book values.\n4. Market Efficiency Theory posits that current market prices reflect all available information, which influences the valuation of company assets. Hence, the need to adjust goodwill and asset valuations aligns with the market's revised valuation of the company.\n5. Despite attempts to control and reduce expenses through the Plan, external factors such as market valuation pressure led to significant impairments, demonstrating how external assessments can necessitate internal financial adjustments.",

Paragraph [261] explicitly states that this plan reduced operating expenses by $15.0 million in fiscal 2023. This supports the first part of the statement.\n\n2. **Impairment of long-lived assets**: Paragraphs [84], [215], [242], and [342] discuss the impairment of long-lived assets. Specifically, paragraph [242] mentions that the company recognized non-cash impairment charges totaling $65.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This confirms the second part of the statement.\n\n3. **Goodwill impairment**: Paragraphs [84], [243], and [289] discuss goodwill impairment. Paragraph [243] states that the company recorded $282.2 million of goodwill impairment for the year ended December 31, 2023, due to a sustained decline in market capitalization. This supports the third part of the statement.\n\n4. **Market efficiency theory**: The impairments mentioned were indeed driven by a decline in market capitalization (for goodwill) and ongoing evaluation of asset utility and alignment with strategic investment priorities (for long-lived assets). This relates to the market efficiency theory, as the market's perception of the company's value influenced its asset valuation.\n\nBased on the provided financial document, all parts of the given statement are supported.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

            " To determine whether the statement about Star Alliance International Corp.'s compliance with fair value measurement standards and its going concern status is entailed or refuted, we need to analyze the provided financial document.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant section of the document relating to fair value measurement standards**:\n   - Paragraph id = 12 and subsequent paragraphs detail the fair value measurement standards.\n\n2. **Extract the fair value hierarchy details**:\n   - The document mentions the three levels of the fair value hierarchy, with Level 3 involving the lowest observable, and most complex valuation assumptions.\n\n3. **Check for compliance with fair value measurement standards**:\n   - Paragraph id = 15 provides a classification of the company\u2019s liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\n   - It explicitly mentions a significant Level 3 derivative liability of $1,109,784 as of December 31, 2023.\n\n4. **Assess going concern status**:\n   - Paragraph id = 47 mentions a summary of quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs used in measuring the derivative liability categorized within Level 3.\n   - The document does not provide explicit information about the company's going concern status. However, it includes various negative balances and liabilities, suggesting potential financial distress.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement claims that Star Alliance International Corp.'s compliance with fair value measurement standards, particularly with its significant Level 3 derivative liability, is contextualized in uncertain going concern status. However, the document supports compliance with fair value measurement standards by explicitly stating inputs used for Level 3 liabilities. The document does not directly address the going concern status but implies potential financial challenges.\n\nTherefore, the statement is partially supported by the document. Nonetheless, the focus on the extent and nature of financial distress suggesting going concern uncertainty is not conclusively detailed in the financial document.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

Any gains or losses due to this translation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax when applicable.\n\n   Translation losses occur when the Euro strengthens against the U.S. dollar. The statement suggests that the increased pre-tax income from higher interest rates could potentially offset these translation losses.\n\n3. **Putting It All Together:**\n   The statement claims that the additional income generated by a 300 basis point increase in interest rates ($10,565) could offset translation losses due to a stronger Euro. This implies that the potential translation losses are less than or equal to $10,565.\n\n   However, the document does not provide specific figures for the translation losses. Therefore, while the possibility exists that the increased income could offset translation losses, we cannot definitively confirm this without knowing the exact amount of the translation losses.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the sensitivity analysis confirms that a 300 basis point interest rate increase would boost pre-tax income by $10,565, the document lacks specific data on translation losses due to a stronger Euro. Thus, we cannot fully verify the statement as it stands.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** due to insufficient information on the exact translation losses."

            " To determine whether the statement is entailed or refuted by the provided financial document, let\u2019s follow the steps outlined:\n\n### Step 1: Read the Given Context and the Statement\nThe provided financial document covers a complex merger process involving several entities and details key aspects such as merger terms, lock-up agreements, and potential impacts on shareholders.\n\n**Statement:**\n\"The lock-up agreements restricting 7,241,179 PubCo Ordinary Shares for up to twelve months post-Business Combination with LEW could create short-term market pressure on PubCo's share value due to limited liquidity, reflecting the broader challenges in enhancing shareholder value following a merger.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Document, Focusing on Relevant Data\nWe need to identify any parts of the document that discuss the lock-up agreements, the impact on liquidity, and the potential for market pressure post-merger.\n\n#### Key Sections from the Document:\n- **Paragraph [25]**: Describes the lock-up agreements, their terms, and the potential duration (up to 12 months for certain shareholders).\n- **Paragraph [67] and [69]**: Highlights risks related to share redemption, liquidity, and the impact of a large number of shares becoming available post-merger.\n\n### Step 3: Reasoning Process\n1. **Lock-Up Agreements (Paragraph [25])**:\n   - The lock-up agreements require certain shareholders owning more than 15% of PubCo Ordinary Shares not to sell their shares for at least 6 months, and up to 12 months in certain cases.\n   - This mimics the statement's mention of lock-up agreements affecting 7,241,179 PubCo Ordinary Shares.\n\n2. **Liquidity and Market Impact (Paragraph [67]):**\n   - The document mentions that if a significant number of Ordinary Shares are redeemed, the company\u2019s shares may become less liquid, adversely affecting the ability to sell in the market.\n   - This part aligns with the statement's concern about potential short-term market pressure due to limited liquidity.\n\n3. **Adverse Effect on Share Value (Paragraph [69])**:\n   - The document states that a significant number of shares being unrestricted after the lock-up period could have an adverse effect on the market price of PubCo Ordinary Shares.\n   - This supports the notion that limited liquidity initially could be followed by market pressure once shares become available.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nBased on the detailed analysis of the relevant paragraphs, the document supports the notion that lock-up agreements can limit liquidity and potentially impact market prices once these shares become available. This aligns with the statement's assertion about the challenges in enhancing shareholder value following the merger.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

Furthermore, mortgage debt is typically secured debt, not unsecured.\n\n2. **\"its reliance on variable interest rates for significant properties like the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport and The Whitehall\"**\n\n   - For the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport, the document states: \"The mortgage on the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport bears interest at a rate tied to SOFR\". Similarly, for The Whitehall, it states: \"The mortgage on The Whitehall, in Houston, Texas bears interest at a rate tied to the New York Prime Rate\". This part of the statement is accurate.\n\n3. **\"make interest rate swap agreements crucial for hedging interest rate risk\"**\n\n   - The document mentions the use of interest rate swaps for hedging, particularly for the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport and the Hotel Alba Tampa, Tapestry Collection by Hilton. It doesn't explicitly state that these are crucial, but given the variable interest rates and the size of the debts, it's reasonable to infer that these swaps are important for hedging risk.\n\n4. **\"amidst anticipated refinancing challenges in 2024 and 2025\"**\n\n   - The document states that there are significant debt maturities in 2024 and 2025, and it mentions potential challenges in refinancing these debts due to market conditions. So, this part of the statement is accurate.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the statement contains a mix of accurate and inaccurate information. The most notable inaccuracy is the misrepresentation of secured mortgage debt as unsecured debt.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

Paragraph 115 supports this increase in the valuation allowance with data points showing the additive effect leading to the end-of-year balance. \n3. The concept of lease accounting, relevant in paragraph 112, indicates that the company's right-of-use liabilities sit at $138 as of December 31, 2023. A high lease liability and a short weighted-average remaining lease term of 0.9 years, alongside a discount rate of 8%, suggest an aggressive leasing strategy that may stress cash flow and affect future taxable income.\n4.

While these factors might have contributed to the company's financial situation, there's no explicit evidence in the provided document linking them directly to the increase in valuation allowance.\n\nHowever, based on the given data, the statement is mostly accurate, and the implications can be inferred. Therefore, the statement is generally supported by the document.\n\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, the statement is entailed."

However, the document provides additional context such as the impact of gold prices and the realized gains from gold sales.\n   - **Offsetting Factors**: The realized gains from gold sales ($1,537,276) helped offset the net investment loss of $(24,388), resulting in a partial mitigation of the overall impact on the NAV.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   The statement accurately reflects the intricacies of the NAV calculation in a fair value accounting environment. The decrease in the fair value of gold holdings did result in a significant drop, but the realized gains from gold sales did indeed help offset some of the net investment losses.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

However, it discusses various aspects of loans:\n     - Gross loans decreased by about $3.5 million.\n     - The accounting principles and financial reporting guidelines generally account for non-performing loans within the broader loan category information.\n   - There is no direct mention that non-performing loans were specifically maintained at zero as of December 31, 2023.\n\n### Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Control Weakness and Deferred Tax Liability**:\n   - The document clearly states that there were internal control weaknesses, specifically mentioning deferred tax liability and its correction.

This indicates heightened exposure and potential risk, which the indemnity clause may not fully cover, necessitating robust internal risk management strategies beyond legal safeguards.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Context**:\n   We will focus on sections related to indemnified loans and credit risk to assess the statement's validity.\n\n   - **Indemnity Liability**:\n     - Paragraph 150 mentions that the Company accounts for the indemnification component of the Loan Servicing Agreement in accordance with ASC 460 Guarantees. It primarily focuses on default-related credit losses and estimated credit losses under the CECL methodology.\n     - Paragraph 236 reaffirms that SHF's indemnity liability reflects management's estimate of probable credit losses in agreement with ASC 460.\n\n   - **Credit Quality of Indemnified Loans**:\n     - Paragraph 325 details the risk rating scale for indemnified loans. The carrying value of indemnified loans with a risk rating of 5 is $28,115,013 as of December 31, 2023, significantly higher than $5,498,042 as of December 31, 2022.\n\n3. **Assessment**:\n   - The indemnified loans indeed show a significant increase in the value associated with risk rating 5, rising from $5,498,042 in 2022 to $28,115,013 in 2023.\n   - This increase indicates heightened exposure to potential risk, confirming the part of the statement that discusses the significant increase in risk rating 5.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The statement correctly acknowledges the increase in the value of loans with risk rating 5. However, it implies that the indemnity clause may not fully cover these risks, suggesting further risk management strategies are necessary. This part of the statement is an interpretation but does not contradict the data provided.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

            " To verify the statement, we need to analyze the given financial document, focusing on the relevant data that pertains to Obligor Group 1's financial performance and any mentioned intercompany payables. Here are the steps to evaluate the statement:\n\n1. **Identify Obligor Group 1's financial performance:**\n   - According to the document, Obligor Group 1 recorded a net loss attributable to Trane Technologies plc of $121.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\n\n2. **Verify intercompany payables:**\n   - The statement mentions significant intercompany payables totaling $5,692.7 million as of March 31, 2024. However, the provided document does not explicitly mention this figure. We need to check if the document offers any related information that supports or refutes this figure.\n\n3. **Assess the impact on consolidated financial performance:**\n   - The statement suggests that these intercompany payables highlight potential concerns in managing intercompany financial flows and their impact on consolidated financial performance. We need to analyze if the intercompany dynamics are indeed problematic based on the provided financial data.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Financial Performance of Obligor Group 1:**\n   - The document states that Obligor Group 1 recorded a net loss attributable to Trane Technologies plc of $121.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. This information is directly given in the document under the \"Summarized Statements of Earnings\" section.\n\n2. **Intercompany Payables:**\n   - The document does not provide a specific figure of $5,692.7 million for intercompany payables. Therefore, we cannot directly verify this part of the statement from the information given.\n\n3. **Impact on Consolidated Financial Performance:**\n   - The intercompany interest and fees for Obligor Group 1 are listed as $(57.0) million, contributing to a net loss. This suggests that intercompany transactions are impacting the financial performance, but without the specific figure of intercompany payables, we cannot quantify the exact impact.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the given financial document, the statement about Obligor Group 1 recording a net loss of $121.8 million is supported by the document. However, the specific figure of $5,692.7 million for intercompany payables is not mentioned in the document, making it impossible to verify that part of the statement. Therefore, the overall statement is partially supported but lacks crucial detail to be fully entailed.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

These changes, partially offset by lower discount rates resulting from lower risk-free rates and changes in credit spreads, as well as the passage of time, resulted in an overall decrease of $26.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2023.\n```\nThis indicates a revaluation gain related to contingent consideration.\n\n#### Impairment of Intangible Assets\nThe document also states:\n```\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2023, we performed an impairment analysis on the IPR&D intangible asset due to our decision to discontinue further development of the drug candidate in immuno-inflammatory diseases. Our impairment analysis resulted in a fair value of the IPR&D intangible asset which was less than the carrying value. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $6.6 million, the full balance of the IPR&D intangible asset.\n```\nThis indicates an impairment loss.\n\n#### Going Concern Status\nThe document provides:\n```\nAs of the report date, the Company does not believe that substantial doubt exists about its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company believes its existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are sufficient to fund its operating and capital expenditure requirements for a period greater than 12 months from the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements.\n```\nThis implies that the company maintains its going concern status.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Statement\n- The document states a revaluation gain of $26.9 million on its contingent consideration for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n- It also mentions an impairment charge of $6.6 million for the IPR&D intangible asset.\n- The company believes it has sufficient financial resources to maintain going concern status.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe statement \"Aclaris Therapeutics recorded a revaluation gain of $26.9 million on its contingent consideration in 2023, positively impacting its loss from operations, despite recording a substantial intangible asset impairment, which aligns with maintaining its going concern status.\" is indeed supported by the given financial document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

The relevant paragraphs are [27], [32], and [161].\n\n   - **Paragraph [27]:**\n     This paragraph discusses the potential structures of a business combination, including scenarios where the company acquires 100% of a target business. It explicitly states that:\n     > \"we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target.\"\n\n     It also mentions that:\n     > \"[t]he issuance of a substantial number of new shares... could result in post-transaction company shareholders owning less than a majority of outstanding shares.\"\n\n   - **Paragraph [32]:**\n     This paragraph discusses shareholder approval and the conditions under which shareholders may redeem their shares.\n\n   - **Paragraph [161]:**\n     This paragraph reiterates the conditions for a business combination, including the potential for a tender offer if shareholder approval is not required.\n\n3. **Document Each Step of the Reasoning Process:**\n   - The document explicitly outlines a scenario in Paragraph [27] where the company could issue new shares in exchange for 100% of the target company's stock.\n   - It further explains that issuing a significant number of new shares could dilute the voting power of the original shareholders to less than 50%.\n   - The document does not contradict the possibility of such an outcome, as it acknowledges that various transaction structures could lead to this result.\n\n4. **Conclude the Analysis:**\n   The financial document supports the scenario described in the statement.

            " To verify the given statement, we need to assess two main points:\n1. The adherence of Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc.'s Omnibus Incentive Plan to SEC filing guidelines per the Dodd-Frank Act.\n2. The existence of performance-based stock units for officers and the Rule 13a-14(a)/15d-14(a) certifications signed by key executives.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Adherence to SEC Filing Guidelines per the Dodd-Frank Act:**\n   - The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions related to executive compensation, such as clawback provisions for incentive-based compensation.\n   - The document mentions policy for the recovery of erroneously awarded compensation (Exhibit 97), which suggests adherence to some of the guidelines under the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\n2. **Performance-Based Stock Units for Officers:**\n   - Paragraph [id = 69] lists various incentive plans, including a \"Form of Performance-based Restricted Stock Units Award Agreement under the Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan.\"\n   - Specifically, it mentions items 10.21+ and 10.35+, which are forms of performance-based restricted stock units for officers.\n\n3. **Rule 13a-14(a)/15d-14(a) Certifications:**\n   - Paragraphs [id = 69 and 71] list Rule 13a-14(a)/15d-14(a) certifications.\n   - These certifications are signed by Gregory B. Maffei (Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer) and Brian J. Wendling (Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer).\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the information provided in the financial document:\n1. The 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan includes performance-based stock units for officers.\n2. The document includes Rule 13a-14(a)/15d-14(a) certifications signed by key executives.\n3. The existence of a policy for the recovery of erroneously awarded compensation indicates adherence to certain SEC guidelines under the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

Loop Industries reported an intangible asset increase to $1,585 by November 2023.\n2. The company claimed no impairment losses, indicating a potential miscalculation in their financial statements.\n\nLet's analyze the document to address these points:\n\n### Step 1: Check Intangible Assets Data\n\nWe need to look at the \"Intangible assets, net\" line in the balance sheets provided in the document.\n\n#### Intangible Assets as of November 30, 2023:\n- Assets > Intangible assets, net: $1,485,000\n\n#### Intangible Assets as of February 28, 2023:\n- Assets > Intangible assets, net: $1,210,000\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Increase in Intangible Assets} = \\text{Intangible Assets as of November 30, 2023} - \\text{Intangible Assets as of February 28, 2023} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Increase in Intangible Assets} = \\$1,485,000 - \\$1,210,000 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Increase in Intangible Assets} = \\$275,000 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Check for Impairment Losses\n\nThe statement also mentions that no impairment losses were claimed. We need to verify if there were any reported impairment losses:\n\nFrom the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss, we look for any mention of impairment losses. There is no explicit mention of impairment losses in the provided financial statements.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Statement's Claims\n\n1. **Intangible Asset Increase:**\n   - The document shows an increase in intangible assets from $1,210,000 to $1,485,000, which is an increase of $275,000, not $1,585.\n\n2. **Impairment Losses:**\n   - There is no mention of impairment losses in the provided financial statements.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the provided financial document:\n\n1. The intangible asset increase reported is $275,000, not $1,585.\n2. There is no mention of impairment losses in the provided financial statements.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailment-refuted** as it contains incorrect information regarding the increase in intangible assets and the absence of impairment losses.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

We utilize the same asset base across our operating segments, which allows us to efficiently optimize our modular assets and redeploy them, as warranted by customer demand.\"\n   - **Evidence of Stability**:\n     - Secured a major new contract in November 2023 and a contract renewal in 2020 under the Government Segment, representing 72% of 2023 revenue.\n   - **Paragraph 24**: Mentions strong relationships with the government and existing contracts, indicating stability, but also highlights potential risks related to payment delays and contract terminations.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the document provides evidence that long-term supply contracts help stabilize revenue and mitigate some risks, there is no explicit statement directly connecting the ownership of major communities to the minimization of operational risks during global economic downturns. The long-term contracts, however, do suggest financial stability and insulation from short-term economic fluctuations.\n\nOverall, the statement is partially supported by the document regarding the benefits of long-term supply contracts, but not fully in terms of the ownership aspect minimizing operational risks specifically.

            " To verify the given statement, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant financial data**:\n   - The document mentions the non-controlling interests for the year ending December 31, 2023, as $98,737,147.\n   - We need to find relevant data points that relate to investments, divestitures, and inventory valuation to see if they support or contradict the statement.\n\n2. **Analyze provided data sections**:\n   - Paragraph [147]: It gives a consolidated statement of changes in members' equity for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\n     ```\n     Balances, December 31, 2022: Noncontrolling Interests: $0\n     Balances, December 31, 2023: Noncontrolling Interests: $98,737,147\n     ```\n   - Paragraph [177]: It details the investments in cooperatives.\n     ```\n     CoBank: 2023: $1,737,862, 2022: $1,705,549\n     ```\n   - Other sections mention changes in inventory and notes about inventory management and investments.\n\n3. **Examine whether the increase in non-controlling interests can be attributed to reduction in investments and divestitures**:\n   - From paragraph [147], we see:\n     ```\n     2022: Noncontrolling Interests = $0\n     2023: Noncontrolling Interests = $98,737,147\n     ```\n   - The increase in noncontrolling interests ($98,737,147) from 2022 to 2023 is documented.\n\n4. **Determine the effect of divestitures and whether they are unrelated to the inventory valuation process**:\n   - The statement suggests that the increase in non-controlling interests is due to a reduction in investments (divestiture activities).\n   - Divestiture activities could mean the company made some strategic exits or sales of investments which led to an increase in noncontrolling interests.\n   - There is no direct mention of divestitures affecting inventory valuation.\n\n5. **Supporting data for divestitures**:\n   - From paragraph [177], the investments in CoBank for 2023 are $1,737,862 and for 2022 are $1,705,549. The slight increase is not sufficient to explain the large jump in noncontrolling interests.\n   - Paragraph [147] also shows new capital units issued in consolidated entities:\n     ```\n     Issuance of new capital units in consolidated entities = $98,077,500\n     ```\n   - This aligns with the increase in noncontrolling interests but doesn\u2019t explicitly mention divestitures. However, it's plausible that issuance of new capital units (likely from divestitures or other financial strategies) could have contributed to this increase.\n\n6. **Summary of Findings**:\n   - The increase in noncontrolling interests can be attributed to the issuance of new capital units in consolidated entities.\n   - No specific data connects this increase directly to divestitures or unrelated to inventory valuation.\n\n### Final Determination:\nThe documents state the noncontrolling interest increased to $98,737,147 in 2023, but do not conclusively connect this increase to divestitures unrelated to the inventory valuation process. The documents show an increase attributed to the issuance of new capital units. Therefore, the statement lacks conclusive support for the specific mechanisms described.\n\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, the statement is **refuted**."

The statement is:\n\n**Statement to verify:** \"The company faces substantial doubt regarding its ability to continue as a going concern due to the certainty of reclassification under the Investment Company Act if it fails to consummate a de-SPAC transaction by November 14, 2023, thereby triggering mandatory liquidation and impacting investors' realized value from redeemable shares.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Document\n\nLet's highlight the key points in the document that relate to the statement:\n\n#### Paragraph 212:\n- **Does not contradict:** The document mentions substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern if it does not consummate a business combination by November 14, 2023.\n\n#### Paragraph 215:\n- **Does not contradict:** The document mentions a risk of being deemed an unregistered investment company if not completing a business combination within the required timeframe, which could lead to liquidation.\n\n#### Paragraph 214 and 330:\n- **Does contradict:** These paragraphs discuss the SEC's Proposed Rules for SPACs, which provide a safe harbor from being deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act if the company completes an initial business combination within 24 months of its effective registration date.\n\n### Step 3: Document the Reasoning Process\n\nThe statement claims that there is substantial doubt due to the **certainty** of reclassification under the Investment Company Act if not completing a business combination by November 14, 2023. However, according to paragraphs 214 and 330, there is only a **risk** of being deemed an investment company if the company fails to meet the timelines, not a certainty.\n\nMoreover, the document specifies possible extensions and amendments, which further reduce the certainty of immediate reclassification and subsequent liquidation purely based on the November 14, 2023 deadline.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nBased on the document, the company does face uncertainty and substantial doubt of its ability to continue as a going concern if it fails to complete a business combination. However, the statement's assertion about **certainty** of reclassification under the Investment Company Act leading to immediate liquidation is not supported by the document. Instead, the document highlights risk and uncertainty rather than certainty.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\"Therefore, the statement is refuted.\""

The knowledge of ASC 842 guides the accounting of lease components, while ASC 606 guides the recognition of revenue from non-lease components when material rights such as optional extensions substantially influence term estimates.\n5. The statement is incorrect because $62.5 million of revenue was correctly recognized according to both ASC 842 and ASC 606, with the company appropriately applying judgment to determine the lease and non-lease components.

            " Based on the provided financial document, let's analyze the relevant information:\n\n1. **Revenue Recognition Policy**: The document states that for contracts containing both a lease component and a services or non-lease component, Target Hospitality accounts for and presents the lease component under ASC 842 and the non-lease component under ASC 606. (Paragraph 66)\n\n2. **Expanded Humanitarian Contract**: The document mentions that the Expanded Humanitarian Contract included an advanced payment that was amortized over the estimated term of the contract ending November 2023. It also specifies that approximately $62.5 million of the $118.2 million of revenue was recognized. (Paragraph 72)\n\n3. **Accounting Standards**: ASC 842 pertains to lease accounting, while ASC 606 pertains to revenue from contracts with customers, including services.\n\nGiven these points, the statement suggests that Target Hospitality miscalculated revenue by applying ASC 842 exclusively and ignoring ASC 606. However, the company's stated policy is to apply both ASC 842 and ASC 606 appropriately.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The financial document explicitly mentions the use of both ASC 842 and ASC 606 for contracts that have both lease and service components.\n- There is no indication in the document that Target Hospitality incorrectly applied only ASC 842 for the Expanded Humanitarian Contract.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe given statement asserts a miscalculation based on an assumption that is not supported by the provided financial document. The document clearly states the company's policy to apply both ASC 842 and ASC 606 for such contracts. Therefore, there is no evidence to support the claim that Target Hospitality miscalculated the revenue by incorrectly applying only ASC 842.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

Paragraph 14 outlines the CPUC's proposed decision for SCE to recover $312 million in capital and $200 million in operational and maintenance expenses related to wildfires, which includes $191 million in revenue subject to amortization over 12 months, pending CPUC final approval.\n3. A proper understanding of revenue recognition principles, specifically Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 980-340 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, necessitates that revenue can't be recognized unless the utility has been legally granted the authority to do so.\n4. The potential financial impact from market risks, as detailed in paragraph 21, could influence SCE\u2019s creditworthiness and hence its ability to hedge such exposures without additional collateral. This aligns with guidelines on market risk exposure assessment under review of qualitative disclosures.

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company is developing its customer base and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenue sufficient to cover its expenses.\"\n- Additionally, it mentions, \"The Company has suffered net losses, negative cash flows from operations, and negative net working capital; which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.\"\n\nThese points confirm that the company has incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows.\n\n### Step 2: Projection of Financial Stability and Recurring Revenue\n**Recurring Revenue Opportunities:**\n- The document discusses various revenue opportunities with specific customers, including:\n  - An e-commerce company planning to deploy devices at approximately 700 sites by the end of 2025, with an estimated recurring revenue of $30 million.\n  - An automaker planning to deploy devices at 12 additional sites by mid-2025, with an estimated annual recurring revenue of $2.5 million.\n  - Total estimated recurring revenue from these projections is $32.5 million.\n\n**Additional Revenue Opportunities:**\n- The document also mentions \"Other Industry Clients,\" but does not specify additional recurring revenue amounts from these clients.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Sum of Recurring Revenue\n**Calculation:**\n- E-commerce revenue: $30 million\n- Automaker revenue: $2.5 million\n- The document does not provide specific figures for other industries combined with these to reach the $50 million mark.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe document provides details about the company's significant net losses and cash flow issues, which aligns with the first part of the statement. However, regarding the projection of $50 million in combined annual recurring revenue by mid-2025, the document only explicitly mentions $32.5 million in potential recurring revenue from the e-commerce and automaker deployments. While the document suggests there are additional opportunities, it does not quantify them.\n\nGiven this information, the statement about projecting $50 million in recurring revenue by mid-2025 is partially supported but not explicitly confirmed by the data provided in the document.

            " To verify the given statement, we need to analyze whether the provided financial document supports the assertion that the PCAOB audit opinion explicitly confirmed the absence of risk in Innodata Inc.'s estimation of uncertain tax positions. Let's analyze the document step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Relevant Sections\n\n1. **Management's Evaluation of Internal Controls**\n   - **Paragraph [id = 58]**:\n     ```\n     Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) - issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\n     ```\n     This paragraph confirms that management evaluated and deemed the internal controls effective.\n\n2. **Audit Opinion on Internal Controls**\n   - **Paragraph [id = 69]**:\n     ```\n     The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n     ```\n     This paragraph states that the PCAOB did not provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\n\n3. **Audit of Tax Positions**\n   - **Paragraph [id = 70]**:\n     ```\n     The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n     ```\n     This section discusses the critical audit matter related to tax positions but does not explicitly confirm the \"absence of risk\" in the estimation of uncertain tax positions.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Documentation's Implications\n\n- **Management's Internal Control Evaluation**: The document clearly states that management evaluated and concluded that the internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2023.\n\n- **PCAOB Audit Opinion**: The document states that the PCAOB did not provide an explicit opinion on the effectiveness of the company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Instead, they obtained an understanding of the internal controls as part of their audit of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n- **Tax Positions Audit**: The PCAOB did mention a critical audit matter regarding the estimation of tax positions, but there is no explicit confirmation that the PCAOB audit opinion confirmed the absence of risk in their estimation of uncertain tax positions.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nBased on the provided information, the document does not support the statement that the PCAOB audit opinion confirmed the absence of risk in Innodata Inc's estimation of uncertain tax positions. The PCAOB explicitly stated they did not offer an opinion on internal controls and only identified tax positions as a critical audit matter.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

A significant downgrade could reduce business volumes, limit access to capital markets, and increase borrowing costs.\n   - **Paragraph 106**: A downgrade in AFG's credit ratings could have a similar adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, including adversely limiting access to capital markets, potentially increasing the cost of debt or increasing borrowing costs.\n\n4. **Evaluate Connection Between Cybersecurity Risks and Credit Ratings/Borrowing Costs**:\n   - The document does not explicitly state that cybersecurity risks directly impact AFG's credit ratings, borrowing costs, or access to capital markets.\n   - However, the interconnected nature of these risks is implied. Cybersecurity incidents could lead to legal and regulatory actions that, in turn, affect AFG's financial health and potentially its credit ratings.\n\n5. **Final Analysis**:\n   - The document suggests that cybersecurity risks can adversely impact AFG's overall financial condition.\n   - While the document does not directly link cybersecurity risks to credit ratings, borrowing costs, or access to capital markets, it does indicate that any significant impact on AFG's financial condition could have far-reaching effects, including on its ratings and market access.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement claims that AFG's inability to effectively manage cybersecurity risks has no impact on its credit ratings and does not influence its borrowing costs or access to capital markets. Based on the analysis, this claim is not supported by the document. The document implies that significant adverse effects on AFG's financial condition from any risk, including cybersecurity, could impact its financial health, which could, in turn, affect its credit ratings, borrowing costs, and access to capital markets. Therefore, the statement is refuted.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

Furthermore, increases below the Cap are explicitly $3.0 million per quarter, refuting the statement's overall accuracy.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

These include:\n     - Paragraph 9: Discusses the committed contracts and their revenue contributions.\n     - Paragraph 13: Details the New PCC Contract and its expected revenue.\n     - Paragraph 18: Provides further insights into the long-term value of the New PCC Contract.\n\n2. **Analyze Revenue Reliance on Long-term Government Contracts**:\n\n   - **Revision of Long-term Contracts**:\n     - According to paragraph 9, approximately 73% of revenues in 2023 were generated under multi-year contracts with committed payment provisions. This highlights a significant reliance on long-term contracts.\n\n   - **New PCC Contract Details**:\n     - Paragraph 13 mentions a new contract (New PCC Contract) with a minimum initial annual revenue contribution of approximately $178 million. With options to extend for up to four additional years, the cumulative minimum revenue is expected to be around $892 million through 2028.\n     - Further details in paragraph 18 show that inclusive of all potential occupancy-based variable services revenue, the maximum total contract amount could be approximately $1.8 billion through 2028 if all options are exercised.\n\n3. **Assessment of Financial Strategy**:\n\n   - **Leveraging Committed Contracts**:\n     - The document emphasizes that Target Hospitality's strategy is to leverage committed contracts to ensure high visibility and recurring revenue. This is evident in the contract details that provide long-term revenue stability.\n\n   - **Revenue Contribution**:\n     - The significant proportion of revenue from committed government contracts (72% as per paragraph 13) demonstrates the company's strategic focus on these contracts for financial stability.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe financial document illustrates that Target Hospitality significantly relies on long-term government contracts, such as the New PCC Contract, for financial stability. The New PCC Contract alone is expected to contribute a minimum of $892 million over five years, which aligns with the strategy to leverage committed contracts to mitigate geopolitical and economic uncertainties.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

Although some liberalization is noted, the need for compliance with PRC regulatory approval processes can affect the company's ability to manage funds effectively in RMB.\n3. In paragraph 276, it's mentioned that the business is conducted through a VIE structure in China. VIEs are commonly used by foreign investors to navigate restrictions on foreign ownership in certain industries in China, but they often come with legal uncertainties.\n4. Paragraph 277 refers to increased scrutiny on VIE arrangements and regulatory changes that could alter the operating environment for companies with a China-centric focus, impacting their strategic adaptability.\n5. Paragraph 281 discusses the potential compliance issues regarding overseas listings under the CSRC's oversight, which further complicates the financial and operational strategies of companies operating through VIEs.\n6.

            " ### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Read and Understand the Context and Statement:**\n   - The financial document discusses the corporate structure and regulatory risks associated with a holding company that operates through a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) in China.\n   - The statement to verify suggests that the regulatory landscape in China, with its evolving policies and liberalization of foreign-invested capital, presents minimal risk and enhances liquidity and financial stability for VIE structures.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Information in the Document:**\n   - **Regulatory Risks and Compliance:**\n     - The document explains that the company is not required to seek permissions from regulatory authorities like the CSRC or CAC for its operations or securities issuances but acknowledges uncertainty about future regulatory actions (Paragraphs 96, 97, 118).\n     - The VIE Agreements have not been tested in court and could be deemed non-compliant with PRC laws, posing risks to operations and financial condition (Paragraphs 98, 105, 116).\n   - **Potential Future Impact:**\n     - If the PRC government or regulatory authorities change regulations or interpretations, the company could face penalties, including revocation of business licenses or fines (Paragraphs 97, 219, 220).\n   - **Dependence on VIE:**\n     - The company's dependence on the VIE for dividends and operations is highlighted, and any adverse regulatory action could significantly impact the company's ability to operate and pay dividends (Paragraphs 276, 282).\n\n3. **Analyze the Statement in Light of the Document:**\n   - The statement claims that the evolving regulatory landscape and liberalization present minimal risks and enhance liquidity and financial stability.\n   - However, the document repeatedly highlights the risks and uncertainties associated with the VIE structure due to potential regulatory changes, lack of clarity in future regulations, and the untested nature of VIE Agreements.\n\n4. **Reasoning and Conclusion:**\n   - The document does not support the statement's claim of minimal risk and enhanced liquidity. Instead, it underscores significant risks related to regulatory compliance, potential adverse actions by authorities, and the impact on the company's operations and ability to pay dividends.\n   - The statement's positive outlook on the regulatory landscape contrasts with the cautious and risk-focused tone of the document.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

            " To verify the statement, let's examine the financial document and focus on relevant information regarding the company's approach to credit loss allowance on its available-for-sale securities:\n\n1. **Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Available-for-Sale Securities:**\n   - The document mentions that the company uses the CECL (Current Expected Credit Loss) framework for determining allowances for credit losses on loans and off-balance sheet credit exposures (paragraph id = 172).\n   - It details that available-for-sale debt securities are evaluated for impairment if the fair value is less than amortized cost, and any estimated credit losses are recorded through a credit loss expense and an allowance (paragraph id = 245).\n\n2. **Evaluation of Unrealized Losses:**\n   - For available-for-sale securities, the company determines if an unrealized loss is due to credit losses or noncredit factors such as current market rates (paragraph id = 245).\n   - The document mentions that the decline in fair value of available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2023, is due to changes in interest rates and not credit quality (paragraph id = 289).\n\n3. **No Credit Loss Allowance for Available-for-Sale Securities:**\n   - Despite having unrealized losses, the company does not consider it necessary to establish an allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale securities because the decline in fair value is attributed to interest rate changes rather than credit quality (paragraph id = 289).\n\nGiven these observations from the financial document:\n\n1. **Assessment Based on IFRS 9:**\n   - IFRS 9 requires assessing credit risk changes and cash flow expectations for impairment decisions.\n   - The company evaluates whether unrealized losses are due to credit quality issues or changes in interest rates (noncredit factors).\n   - Since the decline in fair value is due to interest rate changes, the company does not establish an allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale securities.\n\n2. **Unrealized Losses:**\n   - The statement mentions $23.155 million in unrealized losses due to credit quality.\n   - However, the document does not explicitly mention any unrealized losses specifically due to credit quality but rather attributes the losses to interest rate changes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe company's decision aligns with the principle of assessing credit risk changes and cash flow expectations as required by IFRS 9. Since the unrealized losses are due to interest rate changes and not credit quality issues, the company does not establish an allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale securities. The statement contains an incorrect fact about the $23.155 million unrealized losses being due to credit quality, which contradicts the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

Advanced Oxygen Technologies decreased its property carrying value by $7,753 due to foreign currency translation adjustments.\n2. The company retains the full risk and benefits of ownership through an operating lease with Circle K Denmark A/S.\n\nLet's analyze the financial document to verify these points:\n\n1. **Property Carrying Value Decrease:**\n\n   The financial document, under \"NOTE 4 - PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\" (paragraph id = 35), states:\n   \"During the six-month period ending December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an increase in the carrying value of the Land of $7,753, due to the currency translation difference.\"\n\n   However, the statement claims that the property carrying value decreased by $7,753, which contradicts the information in the document. The document clearly states that there was an increase in the carrying value of the land.\n\n2. **Operating Lease with Circle K Denmark A/S:**\n\n   Under \"Lines of Business\" (paragraph id = 6), the document mentions:\n   \"ANV is a Danish company that owns commercial real estate in Vojens, Denmark. ANV\u2019s revenues are derived solely from the lease revenue from its real estate. Circle K Denmark A/S, formerly StatOil A/S, leases the facility from ANV.

            " Sure, let's break down the statement and verify it against the provided financial document step by step:\n\n1. **The 1-for-3 reverse stock split in March 2023 effectively increased the total authorized shares:**\n   - According to paragraph id = 91 and id = 143, the reverse stock split reduced the total number of shares authorized for issuance from 200,000,000 shares to 66,666,666 shares. This contradicts the statement's claim that the authorized shares increased.\n\n2. **Reduced the proportion of ownership for individual shareholders:**\n   - The reverse stock split combined every three shares into one (paragraph id = 92 and id = 144), effectively reducing the number of shares each shareholder owns by two-thirds. However, it does not change the proportion of ownership since all shareholders are affected equally.\n\n3. **Impacting the evaluation of Pegasus\u2019s acquisition proposals by diminishing the per-share value:**\n   - The reverse stock split increased the per-share value of Pegasus's initial proposal from $0.83 to $2.49 (paragraph id = 66 and id = 94). This contradicts the statement's claim that the per-share value was diminished.\n\n4. **But ultimately deemed undervaluing by the Special Committee:**\n   - The Special Committee concluded that Pegasus's proposals undervalued the company and were not in the best interests of the existing shareholders (paragraph id = 66 and id = 94). This part of the statement is accurate.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the statement contains several inaccuracies. Therefore, the statement is refuted."

Any mention of impairment charges related to goodwill.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Goodwill Recognition:**\n   - The financial document mentions that goodwill amounted to $12,729,056 as of December 31, 2023.\n   - The acquisition of a 40% equity interest in ZTech was for $7 million in cash on October 31, 2023 (paragraph id = 239).\n\n   Since the document mentions the acquisition and the total goodwill but does not explicitly link the $12.3 million goodwill to the ZTech acquisition, we need to confirm whether this sum is solely from ZTech or includes other assets. However, it is clear that goodwill was recognized.\n\n2. **Revenue Recognition:**\n   - The financial document does not provide explicit data on multi-platform sponsorship revenue for 2022 and 2023 directly in the given text.\n   - Paragraph id = 40 mentions that Allied generates revenue from advertising and sponsorship, but no specific figures are provided for the years in question.\n\n   Without explicit numbers for sponsorship revenue, we cannot verify the claim that multiplatform sponsorship revenue remained stagnant at $1.15 million from 2022 to 2023.\n\n3. **Impairment Charges:**\n   - There is no mention of impairment charges related to goodwill in the provided text.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the absence of specific data on multiplatform sponsorship revenue for 2022 and 2023, and the lack of any mention of impairment charges, the statement cannot be fully verified based on the provided financial document. Therefore, the statement that Allied's recognition of $12.3 million in goodwill from the acquisition of ZTech fails to justify any impairment charges by adhering to revenue recognition principles that saw no increase in multiplatform sponsorship revenue is neither explicitly supported nor refuted by the document.\n\n### Final Determination\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

Impairment Evaluations:\n   - The company does assess its proved oil and gas properties for impairment under certain circumstances.\n\n2. Inadequate Replacement of Working Interest Reserves:\n   - The document mentions that the working interests in natural gas extensions and discoveries were not adequate to replace working interest reserves produced in 2023 (Paragraph [id = 52]).\n\n3. Impact on Depreciation and Depletion Calculations:\n   - The document does not explicitly state that there were no impairment evaluations performed despite the inadequate replacement of working interest reserves.\n   - The document also does not specify that the inadequate replacement had no impact on depreciation and depletion calculations.\n   - Critical accounting estimates including depreciation, depletion, and amortization are mentioned, and significant amounts are listed in the financial statements.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude with Final Determination\nThe statement suggests that there were no impairment evaluations required and that the inadequate replacement of working interest reserves did not impact depreciation and depletion calculations. However, the financial document provides evidence that impairment evaluations may occur under various circumstances and that significant depreciation and depletion provisions were recorded. It does not explicitly support the claim that no impairment evaluations were needed in 2023 or that the inadequate replacement had no impact on depreciation and depletion calculations.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

To verify this, we look at the \"CONDENSED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2024 AND 2023\" section. Comparing the nine-month periods ending January 31, 2024, and January 31, 2023, comprehensive income actually increased from $3,665,000 to $5,628,000. Therefore, the statement claiming a significant decrease in comprehensive income is incorrect.\n\n3. **Equity Reductions**: The statement implies that the weak financial performance is primarily due to equity reductions.

            " 1. **Read the Context and Statement Carefully**:\n   The financial document provides details about the quarterly reports for Edison International and Southern California Edison Company, including various financial statements and regulatory compliance certifications.\n\n2. **Analyze the Document for Relevant Information**:\n   - The document mentions the filing of Form 10-Q for both Edison International and Southern California Edison Company for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 (Paragraph id = 0, 1).\n   - It highlights that the financial statements are formatted in Inline XBRL (Paragraph id = 0, 1, 31).\n   - Certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Edison International and Southern California Edison Company pursuant to Section 302 and Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are listed (Exhibit Number 31.1, 31.2, 32.1, 32.2).\n\n3. **Focus on the Statement's Specific Claims**:\n   - **Compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley Act**: The statement mentions certifications under Section 404 and Section 906. The document specifically mentions Section 906 but does not explicitly mention Section 404.\n   - **Prepared in Inline XBRL**: The document confirms that the financial statements are formatted in Inline XBRL.\n   - **Signed by Kara G.

Therefore, the document does not provide explicit evidence of certifications under Section 404.\n\n   Therefore, the statement is **refuted** because the document does not confirm compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act."

Also in paragraph 65, the total liabilities remained relatively stable, slightly decreasing from $215,002,000 to $213,098,000.\n3. Paragraph 66 reveals that the company faced an operating loss and a net loss in 2023, with revenues being $210,106,000 against costs and expenses of $213,823,000.\n4. In paragraph 69, market conditions, specifically the decrease in natural gas prices, forced the company to shift operations and convert drilling rigs from 200 Series to the more demanding 300 Series.\n5. Paragraph 70 detailed that this rapid conversion resulted in asset impairments of $14.7 million during 2023, tamping down asset values and impacting balance sheet strength.\n6. External financial concepts like \"Asset Impairment Indicators\" suggest that frequent conversions and market shifts might lead to overvalued assets requiring impairment.\n7. Standard \"Debt-to-Equity Ratio Analysis\" indicates that an increased debt burden, combined with reduced equity, enhances financial leverage, stressing solvency.\n8. The combination of increased asset impairments and liabilities relative to equity implies a weaker solvency position, affecting the company's financial health.\n9. The statement incorrectly claims an increase and improvement in equity and leverage, whereas the context shows a decline in stockholders' equity from $214,712,000 to $181,579,000, not an increase, and total liabilities only slightly decreased, indicating no significant improvement in leverage or solvency.",

Here\u2019s a step-by-step approach to assess the truthfulness of the statement:\n\n1. **Increase in Total Stockholders' Equity from 2022 to 2023**:\n   - Check the Consolidated Balance Sheets for total stockholders' equity as of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022.\n   - Verify if there is an increase in total stockholders' equity from 2022 to 2023.\n\n2. **Decrease in Debt**:\n   - Check the Consolidated Balance Sheets and related notes for changes in long-term debt from 2022 to 2023.\n   - Look for any mentions of debt reduction in the financial statements or accompanying notes.\n\n3. **Improved Leverage Ratios**:\n   - Leverage ratios generally include metrics such as the debt-to-equity ratio.\n   - Check if there\u2019s any mention of improved leverage ratios in the financial statements or accompanying notes.\n\n4. **Mitigation of Asset Impairment Impact**:\n   - Check the sections discussing asset impairment, particularly the one mentioning the impairment of $14.7 million.\n   - Review if the document discusses the impact of asset impairment on the overall financial health of the company.\n\n5. **Enhancement of Solvency Position**:\n   - Solvency relates to the company\u2019s ability to meet its long-term debts.\n   - Check for any statements or data indicating improved financial health or reduced risk of insolvency.\n\nLet\u2019s examine and document our findings based on the excerpts given:\n\n### Step 1: Increase in Total Stockholders' Equity\n\nRefer to the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023, and 2022 (page 51):\n- Ensure there is an increase in total stockholders' equity from 2022 to 2023.\n\n### Step 2: Decrease in Debt\n\nRefer to the notes on long-term debt (paragraph id = 50):\n- On December 31, 2023, the principal amount of Convertible Notes outstanding was $179.2 million.\n- Check the end balance of long-term debt for December 31, 2022, to see if there has been a reduction.\n\n### Step 3: Improved Leverage Ratios\n\nLook for any mention of improved leverage ratios within the document. The following could be useful:\n- If debt-to-equity ratios are provided, compare them for 2022 and 2023.\n- If there\u2019s no explicit mention, lack of information limits this analysis.\n\n### Step 4: Mitigation of Asset Impairment Impact\n\nReview the section on asset impairment (paragraph id = 43 and 70):\n- $14.7 million of equipment and capital spares were impaired in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n- Check if there\u2019s any discussion on how this significant impairment was offset or managed.\n\n### Step 5: Enhancement of Solvency Position\n\nAnalyze the overall sentiment of the financial statements regarding the company's health:\n- Positive cash flows, increased revenues, or any indicators of improved financial strength would support this.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFinally, if all these steps confirm the trends mentioned in the statement, then the statement aligns with the financial document. If not, the statement will be refuted based on the missing evidence.\n\n**Assuming all steps align with the given data:**\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**.\n\n**If any step contradicts the given data:**\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

This can be seen in paragraph 48, which states that the amount capitalized to capital software assets and software under development intangible asset was lower, resulting in an increase to total operating expenses of approximately 11.1%.\n\n3. **Assessing Gross Margin and Staffing**:\n   However, according to paragraph 46, the gross margin for the three months ended November 30, 2023, was 85.8%, compared to 87.3% for the three months ended November 30, 2022. This indicates a decrease in gross margin, not an increase. The decrease is attributed primarily to increased staffing in the technical and customer support departments.\n\n4. **Conclusion Based on Financial Document**:\n   - The statement claims a reduction in capitalization of software development and lower operating expenses, but the financial document shows an increase in operating expenses due to a lower capitalization.\n   - The statement also suggests an increased gross margin due to decreased staffing, while the document indicates a decrease in gross margin due to increased staffing.\n\nGiven these points, the statement contradicts the actual financial data provided in the document.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

It mentions that changes in the fair value of hedged debt obligations are reflected in the financial statements.\n     - [paragraph id = 71] and [paragraph id = 80]: These paragraphs discuss the use of interest rate swaps as fair value hedges and provide specific numbers related to the effects of these hedges on earnings. Specifically, the table in [paragraph id = 80] shows that for the three months ended January 31, 2024, the interest rate contract related to fixed-rate debt resulted in a $142 million expense recognized in earnings on derivative instruments.\n     - [paragraph id = 60] also notes that if measured at fair value, short- and long-term debt would be classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\n3. **Reasoning Process**:\n   - The statement mentions a negative fair value adjustment of $142 million, which is explicitly referenced in the table within [paragraph id = 80] for the three months ended January 31, 2024. This matches the context provided regarding the use of interest rate swaps and their financial impact.\n   - The context confirms that HP uses industry standard models to measure fair value, aligning with Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, which involves observable inputs.\n\n4. **Final Determination**:\n   The accuracy of the statement is supported by the provided financial document, particularly the data in [paragraph id = 80]. The document confirms both the negative fair value adjustment of $142 million and the context of using interest rate swaps to mitigate exposure to benchmark rate fluctuations, aligned with Level 2 fair value measurement.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

This would result in significant dilution in the equity of our stockholders.\"\n   - Paragraph 19 states: \"As stated above, we will not acquire or merge with any entity which cannot provide independent audited financial statements within a reasonable period of time after closing of the proposed transaction.\"\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - **Tax-Free Reorganizations**: Paragraph 15 mentions tax-free reorganizations under Sections 368(a)(1) or 351 of the Internal Revenue Code, indicating that the company might pursue such a strategy to avoid taxable events.\n   - **Audited Financial Statements**: Paragraph 19 explicitly states that the company will not proceed with an acquisition unless audited financial statements can be provided, reinforcing their commitment to financial transparency.\n   - **Equity Dilution**: Paragraph 15 also discusses significant equity dilution, which aligns with the potential for existing shareholders to retain less than 20% of the issued and outstanding shares.\n\n3. **Reasoning Process**:\n   - The statement suggests that pursuing tax-free reorganizations might allow the company to offer audited financial statements promptly, despite new management. This is somewhat misleading as Paragraph 19 clearly states that the company requires audited financial statements regardless of the tax structure.\n   - The statement correctly notes the potential for significant equity dilution, which is supported by Paragraph 15.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - While the statement correctly identifies the potential for significant equity dilution, it incorrectly suggests that tax-free reorganizations would expedite the provision of audited financial statements, which is not supported by the document. The document explicitly states that audited financial statements are a requirement for closing, regardless of the tax strategy.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

Evaluate if the deposits aim to defer equity liabilities and mitigate potential financial statement impacts under ASC 815.\n4. Confirm if the Public Warrants are at risk of expiring without value if no Business Combination is achieved.\n\nLet's analyze the document step by step:\n\n1. **Total amount of extension deposits:**\n   - From paragraph [279], we have $44,506 deposited each month from December 2, 2023, to December 2, 2024 (12 months).\n   - From paragraph [300], we have $44,506 deposited each month from January 2, 2024, to May 2, 2024 (4 months).\n   - Total deposits = 12 * $44,506 + 4 * $44,506 = $534,072 + $178,024 = $712,096.\n   - The statement mentions only $178,024, which corresponds to the 4 months' deposits mentioned in paragraph [300].\n\n2. **Strategic liquidity management decision:**\n   - The deposits are made to extend the Termination Date, which indicates a strategic decision to manage liquidity and delay potential liquidation of the Trust Account.\n\n3. **Deferring equity liabilities and mitigating financial statement impacts:**\n   - The document does not provide explicit information on the accounting treatment of these deposits under ASC 815. However, the deposits may help postpone the recognition of equity liabilities related to the Trust Account.\n\n4. **Public Warrants' risk of expiry:**\n   - Paragraph [236] mentions Warrants associated with the Units sold in the IPO. If no Business Combination is achieved, these Warrants may expire without value.\n\nBased on the steps above, while the document confirms the amount of $178,024 and the strategic liquidity management decision, it does not provide explicit evidence supporting the aims of deferring equity liabilities and mitigating potential financial statement impacts under ASC 815. However, it does confirm the risk of Public Warrants expiring without value.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** due to lack of explicit information supporting the specific accounting aims mentioned."

It also confirms the use of forward contracts and interest rate swaps to manage these risks. However, the statement mentions \"ineffective disclosure controls confirmed by the CEO and CFO,\" which is not directly supported or refuted in the provided document.

However, the portion about ineffective disclosure controls is not addressed and thus cannot be confirmed.\n\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, the statement is **entailed** regarding the risk management strategies but cannot be fully verified due to the lack of information on the effectiveness of disclosure controls."

However, it mentions \"modeled market prices for the same or similar issues, which are Level 1 inputs\" (paragraph 242) in the context of debt fair value estimation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe financial document supports that Masco Corporation utilized a sophisticated risk-adjusted discount rate for goodwill impairment testing, specifically a range from 11.5% to 13.5%, adjusted based on their assessment of risks impacting each of their businesses. The document confirms:\n- The 9.5% weighted average cost of capital as a basis for 2023.\n- Risk premium added to this to reach the 11.50% to 13.50% range.\n- Utilization of internal projections and market conditions for their forecasting.\n\nHowever, the document does not specifically mention \"Level 2 observable inputs\" for the risk-adjusted discount rate. Instead, it alludes to a mix of various inputs without explicit identification of their levels (Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3).\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

The company has faced recurring losses since inception and cannot assure profitability. This is explicitly mentioned in Paragraphs 36, 37, 144, 228, and 241.\n- **Workforce Reduction:** Paragraph 43 discusses a significant workforce reduction affecting approximately 62% of the workforce in January 2023, aimed at improving operating efficiency and reducing cash burn. However, it also highlights potential unintended consequences and risks associated with this reduction.\n- **Potential Dilution:** Paragraphs 48 and 145 discuss the possibility of dilution if additional funds are raised through the issuance of new shares.\n\n### Step 3: Document the Reasoning Process\n1. **Going Concern Uncertainties:** The recurring losses and negative cash flows mentioned in Paragraphs 36, 37, 144, 228, and 241 indicate significant going concern uncertainties. The statement suggests that these uncertainties have been eliminated, but the document does not support this claim.\n2. **Workforce Reduction:** The workforce reduction, while significant, does not eliminate going concern uncertainties. Paragraph 43 highlights potential negative impacts and risks associated with the reduction.\n3. **Potential Dilution:** The document acknowledges the possibility of dilution if additional funding is needed (Paragraphs 48 and 145), which supports the statement's mention of potential dilution impacting shareholder value.\n\n### Step 4: Final Determination\nThe statement claims that workforce reduction and recurring losses have eliminated going concern uncertainties, which is refuted by multiple paragraphs indicating significant and ongoing going concern uncertainties.

            " To verify the statement, we need to examine the following points based on the provided financial document:\n\n1. **Working Capital Position**: Working capital is defined as Current Assets minus Current Liabilities. We need to check if the working capital has improved as of January 31, 2024, compared to previous periods. However, the provided document does not directly give us the current assets and current liabilities. We will need to infer the information based on available data.\n\n2. **Related Party Transactions**: The statement mentions that the working capital position is buoyed by related party transactions. We should look for any related party transactions in the document.\n\n3. **Revenue Generation**: The statement specifies revenue generation from transactions involving a major shareholder\u2019s relatives. We need to verify if such revenue is present and consistent.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Working Capital Position**:\n   - The only reference to changes in cash is in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As per the document, the \"Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period\" is $8,484 for the six months ended January 31, 2024, compared to $10,575 for the same period in 2023. This shows a decrease in cash. However, working capital also includes other current assets and liabilities, which we do not have information about directly.\n\n2. **Related Party Transactions**:\n   - The Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations show \"Revenue - Related Party\" of $62,443 and \"Cost of revenue - Related Party\" of $55,505 for both the three and six months ended January 31, 2024. This indicates significant related party transactions.\n   - Additionally, the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows show \"Related party receivables and payables\" changes of $10,330 for the six months ended January 31, 2024.\n\n3. **Revenue Generation**:\n   - The Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations show that the \"Revenue - Related Party\" is $62,443 for the three months ended January 31, 2024. Since there is no revenue from other sources listed, this seems to be the sole source of revenue.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **Working Capital Position**: The document does not provide sufficient data to conclusively determine if the working capital position has improved. While there is a decrease in cash, this alone does not account for changes in other current assets and liabilities.\n- **Related Party Transactions**: There are significant related party transactions involving revenue and related party receivables and payables, which is consistent with the statement.\n- **Revenue Generation**: The revenue is indeed coming from related party transactions, but the document does not specify transactions involving a major shareholder\u2019s relatives.\n\nGiven the available data, we cannot conclusively determine if the working capital position has improved. However, the statement regarding related party transactions and revenue generation is partially supported by the document.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

We need to find the relevant data in the financial document.\n\n- **Paragraph [id = 205]** states: \"Unrealized loss of approximately $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to an unrealized gain of approximately $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\"\n- **Paragraph [id = 229]** states: \"Unrealized gain of approximately $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to an unrealized gain of approximately $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\"\n\nFrom these paragraphs, we can calculate the change in the fair value of interest rate swaps from 2022 to 2023:\n- Fair value change in 2022: $2.9 million (gain)\n- Fair value change in 2023: -$0.7 million (loss)\n\nThe difference: $2.9 million (2022) - (-$0.7 million) (2023) = $3.6 million decrease in fair value of interest rate swaps.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Cash Equivalents\nThe statement also mentions maintaining a substantial portion of its cash equivalent balance. We need to find the relevant data in the financial document.\n\n- **Consolidated Balance Sheets (Sotherly Hotels Inc.)** show:\n  - Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023: $17,101,993\n  - Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022: $21,918,680\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Statement with the Calculated Data\n- The statement claims an increase in the fair value of interest rate swaps in 2023, equal to approximately $1,936,179.\n  - However, the document shows a decrease of $3.6 million in the fair value of interest rate swaps.\n- The statement mentions maintaining a substantial portion of its cash equivalent balance.\n  - The document shows a decrease from $21,918,680 in 2022 to $17,101,993 in 2023.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe statement claims an increase in the fair value of interest rate swaps in 2023 and a substantial portion of cash equivalents maintained.

Paragraph 42 supports understanding of shareholder dynamics, indicating that despite acquiring full control, existing shareholders could own a minority of the entity after new shares are issued to facilitate the acquisition.\n4. Valuation multipliers, often used to gauge fair market value, could impact ownership percentages and trigger minority shareholder outcomes, aligning with reverse merger characteristics.\n5.

Let's analyze this claim step-by-step:\n\n1. **Acquiring 100% stake**: The document states that the company can acquire 100% of a target business, and it must have a fair market value of at least 80% of the trust account.\n\n2. **Issuing new shares**: The document acknowledges that the company may issue new shares in exchange for the acquisition.\n\n3. **Maintaining majority ownership**: The statement assumes that original shareholders will always maintain a majority ownership. However, the document does not provide a guarantee regarding the percentage of ownership that original shareholders will retain after a business combination.\n\nLet's consider an example: Assume the trust account has $100 million, and the target business has a fair market value of $85 million (more than 80% of the trust account). If the company issues 85 million new shares to acquire the target while having only 15 million shares originally, original shareholders will own only around 15% of the company post-transaction (15 million original shares out of 100 million total shares). This contradicts the claim that original shareholders will always maintain majority ownership.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the statement is refuted. The document does not support the claim that original shareholders will always maintain majority ownership when acquiring a 100% stake in a target business exceeding the 80% trust fund requirement while issuing new shares.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

It includes details about the IPO, share redemptions, dividend income, and other transactions impacting the trust account from 2021 to 2023.\n\n**Statement:**\nThe decrease in the trust account balance from $58,076,283 at the end of 2021 to $35,909,651 at the end of 2023 highlights the significant impact of the initial IPO funding and subsequent dividend payments on the company\u2019s financial stability, which underscores the ongoing market volatility risks inherent in SPAC operations.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Document\n\n**Paragraphs 4, 60, 61, and 220** provide information about the Trust Account balance at different points in time:\n\n- **Paragraph 4:** Initial placement of $58,075,000 in the Trust Account after the IPO.\n- **Paragraph 60:** As of December 31, 2022, the Trust Account held $34,454,043.\n- **Paragraph 61:** As of December 31, 2021, the Trust Account held $58,076,283.\n- **Paragraph 220:** Table showing Trust Account balances for the years ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022.\n\nFrom **Paragraph 220**:\n- **End of 2021:** $58,076,283\n- **End of 2023:** $35,909,651\n- **Decrease:** $58,076,283 - $35,909,651 = $22,166,632\n\n### Step 3: Document the Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Initial Trust Account Balance (2021):** $58,076,283\n2. **Trust Account Balance (2023):** $35,909,651\n3. **Decrease in Balance:** $22,166,632\n\nThe document shows a significant decrease in the Trust Account balance from $58,076,283 to $35,909,651, largely due to share redemptions (as detailed in Paragraph 220).\n\nThe statement also refers to the impact of the initial IPO funding and subsequent dividend payments on the company\u2019s financial stability, highlighting ongoing market volatility risks in SPAC operations. The document does support that there were substantial movements in the Trust Account due to share redemptions, but it does not explicitly discuss market volatility risks or the specific impact on financial stability beyond the transactions detailed.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nThe financial document confirms the decrease in the Trust Account balance from $58,076,283 at the end of 2021 to $35,909,651 at the end of 2023, primarily due to share redemptions. However, the document does not explicitly discuss market volatility risks or the specific impact on financial stability as mentioned in the statement.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

The choice not to utilize available credit indicates a revised assessment of capacity, possibly to manage financial risk.\n6. The statement is incorrect because paragraph 102 clearly states that as of December 31, 2023, the principal balance outstanding on the revolving working capital loan was $0, allowing an additional $85 million to be borrowed. There was no utilization of this credit line at year-end, contradicting the claim of full utilization.",

This supports the statement's mention of \"generating a record net income of $70.5 million in 2023.\"\n\n2. **Increase in cash from operating activities**: In the \"Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows,\" the cash from operating activities for 2023 is $126,438,041, and for 2022, it is $27,431,814. The increase is $126,438,041 - $27,431,814 = $99,006,227. This supports the statement's mention of \"increasing cash from operations by $97.9 million.\"\n\n3. **Revolving working capital loan**: In the \"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,\" it is mentioned that the revolving term loan was $0.0 million as of December 31, 2023. This contradicts the statement's claim that the company \"fully utilized their $85 million available in the revolving working capital loan at year-end.\"\n\nBased on the above analysis, the statement is not entirely accurate due to the incorrect information about the revolving working capital loan.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, the statement is refuted."

However, it does not specify the direction of this adjustment (i.e., whether an upgrade would increase or decrease the interest rate).\n\n4. **Reasoning Process:**\n   - Generally, an upgrade in credit rating would imply a lower risk for the lender, which usually results in a lower interest rate rather than an increase.\n   - The document does not provide explicit information that an upgrade would increase the interest cost. Instead, it mentions adjustments in general terms.\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - The document does not support the specific claim that an upgrade would increase interest costs. Instead, typical financial practices suggest the opposite.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given the lack of explicit information in the document regarding an increase in interest costs due to an upgrade, and based on standard financial practices, the statement appears to be refuted by the document.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

To assess this, we need to identify any mention of \"customer incentives\" or related terms in the document.\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe document does not explicitly mention \"variable consideration from customer incentives\" or indicate that this is a critical audit matter. Paragraphs [242] and [298] discuss customer relationships, estimates, and revenue recognition, but do not delve into the specifics of customer incentives as a critical audit matter.\n\n### Step 2: Percentage of Net Revenue Denominated in Foreign Currencies\nThe statement claims that 25% of Corsair Gaming's net revenue is denominated in foreign currencies.\n\n**Analysis:**\nIn paragraph [303], it is mentioned: \"Approximately 18.2% of our net revenue in 2023 was denominated in foreign currencies, primarily Euro and GBP.\" This contradicts the statement, which claims that 25% of the net revenue is denominated in foreign currencies.\n\n### Step 3: Impact of Exchange Rate Fluctuations on Foreign Currency Contracts\nThe statement suggests that a 10% fluctuation in exchange rates would impact the net gain or loss on foreign currency contracts by approximately $1.5 million.\n\n**Analysis:**\nIn paragraph [328], it is stated: \"The notional principal amount of outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts was $44.3 million as of December 31, 2023.\" The net fair value gain (loss) for these contracts was $(1.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nTo estimate the impact of a 10% fluctuation:\n- The notional principal amount of foreign exchange contracts is $44.3 million.\n- A 10% fluctuation would be 0.10 * $44.3 million = $4.43 million.\n- This is significantly higher than the $1.5 million stated impact.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the provided statement is refuted by the financial document:\n\n- There is no explicit mention of \"variable consideration from customer incentives\" being a critical audit matter.\n- The document states that 18.2% of net revenue is denominated in foreign currencies, not 25%.\n- A 10% fluctuation in exchange rates would impact the foreign currency contracts by $4.43 million, not $1.5 million.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

However, the document indicates minimal interest rate risk impact, no mention of strategic covenant management, and significant (not minimal) debt repayments.\n\nSince the statement does not align with the information provided in the document, specifically in terms of interest rate exposure and the amount of debt repayment, we conclude that the statement is refuted.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted**."

Paragraph 8 explains that the Company uses Level 2 inputs for certain financial instruments like cash equivalents and derivatives, utilizing observable market data such as interest rates and bond yields.\n3. Paragraph 10 describes how the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to calculate lease liabilities because the leases do not provide an implicit rate, linking it to observable market trends.\n4. Paragraph 11 adds that for leases, the Company is using observable market data to estimate future base rate escalations, reflecting consistent application of external market data in financial strategies.\n5. Paragraph 16 identifies derivative financial instruments using Level 2 measurements, aligning with the strategy disclosed in paragraph 8.\n6. Together, this indicates a strategic alignment between using market-based assumptions in evaluating both fair value of financial instruments and calculating lease obligations.\n7. The statement is incorrect because lease accounting indeed relies on observable market data, such as the incremental borrowing rate, aligning financial assumptions with market conditions. The claim about using internal estimations regardless of market conditions for lease accounting does not align with the context, where observable market trends are applied.",

            " To verify the given statement, let's analyze the relevant sections of the provided financial document:\n\n1. **Level 2 Fair Value Measurement for Cash Equivalents and Derivatives:**\n   - Paragraph 8 states: \"The Level 2 cash equivalents include money market funds, commercial paper and short-term U.S. agency securities.\"\n   - Paragraph 16 states: \"Its derivatives are measured at fair value... When the Company\u2019s derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income...\"\n   - Paragraph 8 also states: \"In determining fair value of Level 2 assets, the Company uses a market approach utilizing valuation models that incorporate observable inputs such as interest rates, bond yields and quoted prices for similar assets.\"\n   - This shows that the Company uses observable market data for its Level 2 fair value measurements.\n\n2. **Lease Accounting:**\n   - Paragraph 10 states: \"ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Certain leases contain variable contractual obligations as a result of future base rate escalations which are estimated based on observed trends... The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\"\n   - This indicates that lease accounting involves internal estimations (e.g., incremental borrowing rate) and observed trends, which may not necessarily correlate with current market conditions.\n\n3. **Divergence from Market Conditions:**\n   - The use of market data in Level 2 fair value measurements (as stated in Paragraph 8) contrasts with the internal estimations and observed trends used in lease accounting (as stated in Paragraph 10). This divergence supports the statement that lease accounting may not always align with current market conditions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe analysis of the financial document confirms that the Company relies on market data for Level 2 fair value measurements of cash equivalents and derivatives. Meanwhile, lease accounting employs internal estimations and observed trends, which could diverge from market conditions.\n\nTherefore, the statement is entailed."

            " Let's analyze the given statement step by step and compare it against the information provided in the financial document:\n\n1. **Reliance on Fully Insured HSA Cash**:\n   - **Document Information**: Paragraph 69 states that \"The HSA cash held through our insurance company partners is not federally insured, and our members bear the risk of loss with respect to either the failure of the insurance company partner...\"\n   - This clearly indicates that the HSA cash held with insurance company partners is not fully insured. Thus, the first part of the statement claiming reliance on \"fully insured HSA cash\" is not supported by the document.\n\n2. **Reputational Risks**:\n   - **Document Information**: Paragraph 70 discusses potential risks, stating \"In the event of such a failure of, or breach by, one of our insurance company partners, the HSA cash held through that insurance company partner would be at risk and no assurance can be given that our contractual arrangements with that insurance company partner would be sufficient for our members to fully recover their HSA cash, which would in turn result in reputational and financial harm to the Company.\"\n   - This aligns with the fact that there are reputational risks associated with the failure of insurance company partners to guarantee these funds.\n\n3. **Brand Integrity and Financial Stability**:\n   - The document does not explicitly indicate that the company's brand integrity and financial stability would be solidified should an adverse event occur. Instead, it points to potential harm.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the analysis above, the statement that \"HealthEquity's reliance on fully insured HSA cash held with insurance company partners, along with the reputational risks associated with guaranteeing these funds, could solidify the company's brand integrity and financial stability, should an adverse event occur\" is contradicted by the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

Analyzing the provided financial document:\n   - From paragraph id = 140, we find that stock-based compensation expenses were $250,359 in 2022 and $204,797 in 2023. This confirms the first point of the statement that there was a decline in stock-based compensation expenses from 2022 to 2023.\n   - From paragraph id = 147, we see that the net operating loss carryforwards, which contribute to the deferred tax assets, were $132,632 in 2022 and reduced to $0 in 2023. This contradicts the second point of the statement, as it shows a decrease, not an increase, in the net operating loss deferred tax asset.\n\n3. The statement also mentions that these changes align with the broader context of reducing expenses given the accruals for legal reserves. However, the document does not provide any information about legal reserves, so this part of the statement cannot be verified.\n\nConclusion: The statement is refuted because although the stock-based compensation expenses decreased, the net operating loss deferred tax asset also decreased, contradicting the statement's claim of an increase.
