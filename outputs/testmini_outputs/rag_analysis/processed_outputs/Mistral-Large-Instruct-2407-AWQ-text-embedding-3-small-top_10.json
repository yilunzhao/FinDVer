Companies receive emission allowances from the EU auctions with some of this revenue allocated to the maritime sector to support innovation in low-carbon technologies and to contribute to zero pollution objectives.\"\n\n   - **Analysis:**\n     - The document states that some of the revenue from the ETS will be allocated to the maritime sector for low-carbon technologies, which contradicts the statement's claim that all revenue is allocated to sectors outside maritime innovations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe provided statement is partly correct regarding the interest in transporting liquified CO2 and the shift towards renewable energy. However, it is incorrect in stating that the EU Emissions Trading Scheme allocates all revenue to sectors outside maritime innovations.\n\n**Final Determination:**\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

Total Principal Balance Outstanding on Acquisitions Payable\n\nFrom the document:\n- The principal balance for the unsecured convertible promissory notes related to acquisitions as of January 31, 2024 is detailed in paragraph id = 67:\n  - The Company transferred the principal balance for the Unsecured Convertible Promissory Notes of $1,119,996 to the balance of the Unsecured Adjustable Promissory Notes.\n  - Also, $119,996 was added to the principal balance for default interest for missing principal payments on the Notes, resulting in a total principal balance of $1,119,996 + $119,996 = $1,239,992 (as of January 31, 2024).\n\nHowever, the amortized discount should be examined to accurately reflect the net principal balance:\n- Paragraph id = 84 mentions: Total unamortized discount on the convertible notes as of January 31, 2024, was $460,352.\n  - Thus, the net principal balance should possibly be $1,239,992 - $460,352 = $779,640.\n\n### 2. Convertible Note Agreements with Extended Maturity Dates\n\n- The document shows several convertible note agreements with extended maturity dates until December 31, 2024:\n  - Paragraph id = 73 (On October 22, 2021): an aggregate principal amount of $150,000 was extended to December 31, 2024.\n  - Paragraph id = 72 (On April 14, 2021): an aggregate principal amount of $250,000 was extended to December 31, 2024.\n  - Additional notes show similar extensions, but none matches $660,000.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe statement that \"as of January 31, 2024, the total principal balance outstanding on acquisitions payable was $1,130,000, with a 3% fee added due to maturity date extensions\" does not match the document details.\n\nA detailed calculation:\n- Net principal balance outstanding is derived: $1,239,992 - $460,352 \u2248 $779,640.\n- No specific mention of a promissory note with a $660,000 principal entered on January 25, 2023.\n\nTherefore, based on the financial document, neither the total principal balance nor the specific note details match the provided statement.\n\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, the statement is refuted."

During the three months ended December 31, 2023, no director or officer of the Company adopted or terminated a \u201cRule 10b5-1 trading arrangement\u201d or \u201cnon-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,\u201d as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\n```\nThis statement directly contradicts the claim that several directors adopted insider trading arrangements during the three months ended December 31, 2023.\n\n#### 2. Executive Team\n\nThe document provides information about the executive team and directors under [paragraph id = 39]:\n```\nThe following table provides information regarding our executive officers as of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\n...\n| Name | ... | Title/Position | ... | Age |\n| William (\u201cBill\u201d) Santana Li | ... | Chairman and Chief Executive Officer | ... | 54 |\n| ...\n| William (\u201cWill\u201d) G. Billings | ... | Director | ... | 47 |\n| Robert (\u201cBob\u201d) A. Mocny | ... | Director | ... | 66 |\n| Melvin (\u201cMel\u201d) W. Torrie | ... | Director | ... | 53 |\n```\nThis information confirms that William Santana Li and Robert Mocny are part of the company's executive team as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Director, respectively.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement regarding the executive team is accurate. However, the statement about insider trading arrangements during the three months ended December 31, 2023, is incorrect based on the provided document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** due to the factual inaccuracy related to insider trading arrangements."

The statement we need to verify reads:\n\n\"The U.S. Concrete Pumping segment, representing 72% of total revenue, significantly relies on its Brundage-Bone and Capital Pumping brands with a fleet of approximately 1,760 units contributing to a global fleet of 1,580 units as of October 31, 2023, indicating the segment's pivotal role within the company's operations.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Document\nLet's look at the relevant financial data and facts from the document:\n\n1. **Revenue Share of U.S. Concrete Pumping Segment**\n   - From **Paragraph ID = 6**, \"Our U.S. concrete pumping services segment represented 72% of our total revenue for the year ended October 31, 2023.\"\n\n2. **Fleet Size**\n   - From **Paragraph ID = 6**, \"Our Brundage-Bone and Capital Pumping brands, which as of October 31, 2023 operated a total fleet of approximately 1,060 equipment units.\"\n\n### Step 3: Document Each Step of Reasoning Process\n1. The statement mentions that the U.S. Concrete Pumping segment represents 72% of total revenue, which matches the document.\n2. The statement says the segment relies on its Brundage-Bone and Capital Pumping brands with a fleet of approximately 1,760 units. However, the document specifies a fleet size of approximately 1,060 units for these brands.\n3. The statement mentions a global fleet of 1,580 units, which is not explicitly supported by the document. The document only provides the fleet size for the U.S. segment's brands.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude the Analysis\nThe discrepancies in fleet size numbers clearly contradict the document. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown:\n- Documented fleet size for Brundage-Bone and Capital Pumping brands is 1,060 units.\n- The statement claims 1,760 units.\n- The statement also mentions a global fleet of 1,580 units, which is not supported by the document and contradicts the U.S. segment's fleet size.\n\n### Final Determination\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

European regulators granted aldoxorubicin Orphan designation for STS which confers ten years of market exclusivity among other benefits.\"\n\n  - **Paragraph id = 212:** (Duplicate information) \"Aldoxorubicin has received Orphan Drug Designation ('ODD') by the FDA for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma ('STS'). ODD provides several benefits including seven years of market exclusivity after approval, certain R&D related tax credits, and protocol assistance by the FDA. European regulators granted aldoxorubicin Orphan designation for STS which confers ten years of market exclusivity among other benefits.\"\n\n  Both paragraphs indicate that aldoxorubicin has market exclusivity for soft tissue sarcoma not only in the US (seven years) but also in Europe (ten years).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe document supports the first part of the statement regarding the $1 million milestone payment for arimoclomol after the FDA accepted the NDA in February 2024. However, the second part of the statement (aldoxorubicin maintains its market exclusivity for soft tissue sarcoma in the US only) is incorrect because the document indicates that aldoxorubicin has market exclusivity in both the US and Europe.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

            " ### Step 1: Identify Relevant Paragraphs and Data Points\nTo verify the given statement, we need to identify the relevant paragraphs and data points in the financial document that pertain to treasury stock, working capital, prepaid expenses, and accounts payable.\n\n**Treasury Stock:**\n- [paragraph id = 13]\n- [paragraph id = 52] Consolidated Balance Sheets\n- [paragraph id = 56] Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders\u2019 Equity (Deficit)\n- [paragraph id = 90] Note 5. Stockholders\u2019 Equity (Deficit)\n- [paragraph id = 92]\n\n**Working Capital:**\n- [paragraph id = 31] Liquidity and Capital Resources\n- [paragraph id = 52] Consolidated Balance Sheets\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Data for Treasury Stock\n\n**As of September 30, 2023:**\n- From [paragraph id = 52], under the Consolidated Balance Sheets, it states that treasury stock as of September 30, 2023, was 691,250 shares.\n- This is corroborated in [paragraph id = 92] which also states, \"At September 30, 2023, the Company held 691,250 shares in treasury.\"\n\nThe statement claims there were 600,000 treasury shares, but the document states there were 691,250 shares.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Data for Working Capital\n\nWorking capital is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities.\n\n**As of September 30, 2022:**\n- Current assets = $2,128,035\n- Current liabilities = $1,296,376\nSo, working capital = $2,128,035 - $1,296,376 = $831,659\n\n**As of September 30, 2023:**\n- Current assets = $128,443\n- Current liabilities = $1,657,558\nSo, working capital = $128,443 - $1,657,558 = ($1,529,115)\n\nThe decrease in working capital from September 30, 2022, to September 30, 2023:\n- $831,659 - ($1,529,115) = $2,360,774\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Causes of Working Capital Decrease\n\nFrom [paragraph id = 31], the decrease in working capital is attributed to:\n- A decrease in prepaid expenses of $1,956,215.\n- An increase in accounts payable of $20,795.\n\n### Step 5: Compare with the Statement\n\n**Treasury Stock:**\n- The statement claims 600,000 shares, but the document states 691,250 shares.\n\n**Working Capital Decrease:**\n- The statement claims a decrease of $3,360,774, but the document shows a decrease of $2,360,774.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter carefully analyzing the relevant data points from the financial document, it is evident that both the number of treasury shares and the decrease in working capital provided in the statement are incorrect when compared to the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

Capital Expenditures for Facility Maintenance and Improvements\nThe statement claims that PSOC \"plans to spend approximately $180 million on capital expenditures for facility maintenance and improvements in 2024.\"\n\n- The financial document does not mention any specific plans for capital expenditures related to facility maintenance and improvements for 2024.\n\n### 3.

            " Sure, let's go through the steps to verify the statement.\n\n### Step 1: Read the Given Context and Statement\n- **Context:** The financial document provides detailed income statements and explanations for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and March 31, 2023.\n- **Statement to verify:** \"Public Storage's total operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was fueled by a combination of decreased net operating income from newly developed and expanded facilities and increased property operating costs due to solar panel installations, despite the lower interest expenses incurred from July 2023 notes issuance.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Document\n1. **Net Operating Income from Newly Developed and Expanded Facilities:**\n   - **Paragraph 70 and 117:** The document states that the net operating income from newly developed and expanded facilities contributed $34.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024.\n   - **Net operating income increased.**\n\n2. **Property Operating Costs:**\n   - **Paragraph 176:** The document mentions increased property tax and marketing expenses.\n   - **Net operating income of Same Store Facilities decreased by $10.3 million due to increased property tax and marketing expense.**\n\n3. **Interest Expenses:**\n   - **Paragraph 1:** Interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024, is $67,778 thousand, compared to $36,101 thousand for the same period in 2023.\n   - **Interest expenses increased.**\n\n### Step 3: Document the Reasoning Process\n- The statement claims decreased net operating income from newly developed and expanded facilities, but the document shows an **increase** in net operating income from these facilities ($34.6 million).\n- The statement mentions increased property operating costs, which aligns with the document. However, the document attributes this increase to property tax and marketing expenses, not solar panel installations specifically.\n- The statement mentions lower interest expenses, but the document shows an **increase** in interest expenses ($67,778 thousand in 2024 vs. $36,101 thousand in 2023).\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe statement is contradicted by the financial document in two key aspects:\n1. The net operating income from newly developed and expanded facilities increased, not decreased.\n2. The interest expenses increased, not decreased.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted.\n\n**Conclusion: \"Therefore, the statement is refuted.\"**"

            " ### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Step 1: Read and Understand the Document and Statement\nThe provided financial document discusses the company's liquidity, capital resources, and financial activities over certain periods. The statement mentions a significant increase in working capital and a net cash increase, despite a net loss and weak financial controls. The company believes it can fund operations for twelve months through expected cash flows and shareholder loans.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze Relevant Financial Data\n- **Working Capital**:\n  - As of December 31, 2023: $(6,305,702) (a deficit)\n  - As of June 30, 2023: $34,997,532\n  - Decrease from June to December 2023: $41,303,234 (118.02%)\n\n- **Cash and Cash Equivalents**:\n  - As of December 31, 2023: $15,343\n  - As of June 30, 2023: $47,246\n  - Decrease from June to December 2023: $31,903\n\n- **Cash Flow Activities**:\n  - Net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended December 31, 2023: $35,025\n  - Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended December 31, 2022: $512,196\n\n- **Net Income/Loss**:\n  - Net loss for the six months ended December 31, 2023: $627,911\n  - Net income for the six months ended December 31, 2022: $472,858\n\n#### Step 3: Document Reasoning Process\n- **Working Capital Decrease**:\n  The document mentions a significant decrease in working capital by $41,303,234 from June 2023 to December 2023, resulting in a deficit. This contradicts the statement's mention of a significant increase in working capital.\n\n- **Cash and Cash Equivalents**:\n  The document shows a decrease in cash and cash equivalents from $47,246 to $15,343, which is a decrease, not an increase.\n\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operations**:\n  For the six months ended December 31, 2023, the company used $35,025 in operating activities, indicating a net cash outflow, not an inflow.\n\n- **Net Income/Loss**:\n  The company reported a net loss of $627,911 for the six months ended December 31, 2023, indicating financial struggle.\n\n- **Funding Belief**:\n  The document states that the company believes its current working capital position, expected future cash flows, and loans from major shareholders will be adequate to fund operations for the next twelve months.\n\n#### Step 4: Conclusion\nGiven the significant decrease in working capital, the decrease in cash and cash equivalents, and the net cash outflow from operating activities, the statement's assertions about increases in these areas are not supported by the provided financial document. Therefore, the statement is:\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

            " To verify the statement, let's break it down into its components and analyze each one based on the provided financial document:\n\n### 1. **The bank's deposits are predominantly located in the San Francisco Bay Area**\n\nFrom the context:\n- **Clientele and Geographic Concentration**: The document states that \"Our branch and loan production offices are located in three contiguous counties in the San Francisco Bay Area: Alameda, Contra Costa and Santa Clara; and Sacramento County.\" (Paragraph 6)\n\nThis implies that the bank's operations, including its deposit base, are primarily within the San Francisco Bay Area, given that most of its offices are located there. Therefore, this part of the statement is supported by the document.\n\n### 2. **The largest depositor representing 15% of total deposits as of December 31, 2023**\n\nThe document does not specify a percentage or an amount attributed to the largest depositor. The closest reference to deposits is:\n- **Deposits Table**: The document provides a breakdown of deposits at December 31, 2023, but it does not mention the largest depositor specifically or the percentage of total deposits they represent.\n\nTherefore, this part of the statement is not entailed by the document because there is no information about the largest depositor's share.\n\n### 3. **Faces intense competition from local, regional, and national institutions that have fewer regulatory constraints**\n\nFrom the context:\n- **Competition**: The document states, \"We face competition from other companies that offer banking and financial services. We conduct our banking operations primarily in Northern California. Many of our competitors offer the same, or a wider variety of, banking services within our market areas. These competitors include banks with nationwide operations, regional banks, and community banks.\" (Paragraph 26)\n- **Regulatory Constraints**: \"Some of our non-banking competitors, such as fintech lenders, have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures.\" (Paragraph 6)\n\nThis part of the statement is supported by the document as it explicitly mentions competition from various financial institutions and the regulatory conditions faced by these competitors.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of the document:\n\n- **The bank\u2019s deposits are predominantly located in the San Francisco Bay Area**: This is entailed by the document.\n- **The largest depositor representing 15% of total deposits as of December 31, 2023**: This is refuted by the document as there is no information supporting this claim.\n- **Faces intense competition from local, regional, and national institutions that have fewer regulatory constraints**: This is entailed by the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** due to the lack of information about the largest depositor representing 15% of total deposits.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

Raising capital being potentially dilutive or imposing unfavorable terms\n- **From the document (paragraph id = 104):** \"An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk.

Equity Incentive Compensation Plan (the \u201c2023 Plan\u201d), which was adopted by the Board on March 17, 2023.

Our Board has made no determination to date to declare cash dividends during the foreseeable future, but is not likely to do so. There are no restrictions on our ability to pay dividends.\"\n\n### Step 3: Document the reasoning process\n- The stock price fluctuation between $1.69 and $3.98 in 2023 is explicitly mentioned in the document.\n- The document discusses risks associated with investments, which can include dilution and unfavorable terms when raising capital, especially given the equity incentive compensation plan that involves issuing more shares.\n- The document does not provide any information about 32% of shares being controlled by insiders.\n- The document explicitly states that no cash dividends have been declared for the fiscal years ended on December 31, 2023 or 2022, and the Board is not likely to declare cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nBased on the provided document, the statement about the stock price fluctuation and no dividends being paid is supported by the document.

            " Sure, let's break this analysis down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Reading the Context and Statement**:\n   - We need to examine portions of the financial document regarding the Marygold Companies, particularly their operating income and revenue.\n   - The statement claims that:\n     - The company faced a $1.1 million increase in operating income for the three months ending December 31, 2023.\n     - This increase was largely due to increased marketing expenses in subsidiaries.\n     - There was also a $1.0 million revenue decline for the six months, primarily due to decreased AUM in USCF Investments.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Document**:\n   - **Operating Income for Three Months Ending December 31, 2023**:\n     - From paragraph id=81: \"The Company\u2019s operating loss for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was ($1.0) million as compared to operating income of $0.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. This represents a decrease in operating income of $1.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year.\"\n     - The document explicitly states a decrease (reduction) in operating income by $1.1 million, not an increase.\n\n   - **Reason for Decrease**:\n     - The document mentions, \"Apart from the $0.3 million decline in revenues, the remaining $0.8 million difference in operating income (loss) is primarily attributed to an increase in marketing and development expenses incurred at Marygold & Co. and Original Sprout.\"\n\n   - **Revenue Decline for Six Months**:\n     - From paragraph id=85: \"Consolidated revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2023 was $16.7 million representing a $1.0 million or 6% decrease from the six months ended December 31, 2022 revenue of $17.7 million. The decrease in consolidated revenue was primarily attributed to lower revenues by $0.6 million from lower AUM at USCF Investments...\"\n\n3. **Documenting Reasoning**:\n   - **Operating Income**:\n     - The operating income did decrease by $1.1 million, which contradicts the claim of an increase.\n     - The decrease was indeed largely due to increased marketing expenses in subsidiaries.\n\n   - **Revenue Decline**:\n     - There was a $1.0 million revenue decline over the six months, primarily due to decreased AUM in USCF Investments, which matches the statement.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The statement incorrectly states that there was an increase in operating income for the three months ending December 31, 2023. The document explicitly shows a decrease.\n   - The reduction in operating income was indeed largely due to increased marketing expenses, aligning with the statement.\n   - The revenue decline part of the statement is accurate.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

However, we can calculate this by comparing the deferred tax assets and liabilities between 2024 and 2023.\n   - Deferred tax assets increased from $65,554 thousand to $72,709 thousand (an increase of $7,155 thousand).\n   - Deferred tax liabilities decreased from $(82,665) thousand to $(68,670) thousand (a decrease of $13,995 thousand).\n   The total deferred tax benefit for 2024 is the sum of the increase in deferred tax assets and the decrease in deferred tax liabilities, which is $7,155 thousand + $13,995 thousand = $21,150 thousand.\n\n2. **Litigation issues involving a terminated lease:**\n   There is no mention of any litigation issues involving a terminated lease in the provided financial document.\n\n3. **Unrecognized tax benefits at the end of fiscal year 2024:**\n   According to the document (paragraph id = 391), the gross unrecognized tax benefits at the end of the year for January 31, 2024, were $19,213 thousand.\n\nBased on these points, we can conclude that the statement is incorrect because:\n- The total deferred tax benefits recorded in fiscal year 2024 were not $13,995 thousand but $21,150 thousand.\n- There is no mention of any litigation issues involving a terminated lease.\n- The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at the end of fiscal year 2024 is correctly stated as $19,213 thousand, but the statement about a significant decrease is subjective and not explicitly supported by the document.\n\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, the statement is refuted."

However, it also states that the Bank is headquartered in Walnut Creek (paragraph 1), not Sacramento.

It also mentions restrictions on dividends and stock repurchases, capital adequacy requirements, and restrictions on activities of undercapitalized institutions (paragraphs 16, 18). Therefore, this part of the statement is correct.\n\n3. **\"heightened risks from its large borrower relationships\"**\n\n   The document mentions concentration risk due to large borrower relationships in paragraph 24: \"We are exposed to higher credit risk... relationship exposure with a number of large borrowers.\" Thus, this part of the statement is correct.\n\n4. **\"dependence on significant agricultural loans\"**\n\n   The document does not mention any agricultural loans or agricultural lending activities. Therefore, this part of the statement is incorrect.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the statement is not entirely accurate. Therefore, the statement is **refuted**."

We need to find the specific figures for deferred subscription revenue in the document.\n\n   From paragraph [18]:\n   - At November 30, 2023, deferred subscription revenue was $87.2 million.\n   - At November 30, 2022, deferred subscription revenue was $74.9 million.\n\n   Calculating the percentage increase:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{87.2 - 74.9}{74.9} \\times 100 \\approx 16.4\\%\n   \\]\n   This shows that deferred subscription revenue increased by 16.4%, contradicting the statement's claim of a 14% decrease.\n\n2. **Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA**:\n   The statement claims that consolidated adjusted EBITDA decreased from $11.5 million to $11.0 million for the quarter ended November 30, 2023.\n\n   From paragraph [19]:\n   - Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended November 30, 2023, was $11.0 million.\n   - Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of the prior year was $11.5 million.\n\n   This matches the statement's claim about the decrease in consolidated adjusted EBITDA.\n\n3. **Cash Flows from Operating Activities**:\n   The statement claims strong cash flows from operating activities driven by favorable working capital changes.\n\n   From paragraph [19]:\n   - Cash flows from operating activities increased to $17.4 million compared with $3.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.\n   - The increase was primarily due to favorable changes in working capital and featured strong collections of accounts receivable.\n\n   This information matches the statement's claim about strong cash flows from operating activities.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The statement about the 14% decrease in deferred subscription revenue is refuted by the document, which shows an increase of 16.4%.\n- The statement about the decrease in consolidated adjusted EBITDA is supported by the document.\n- The statement about strong cash flows from operating activities is supported by the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** based on the information provided in the document."

It does not specify an increase in operating income margin.\n   - **Net Sales**:\n     - The document does not provide specific information about a 7.0% increase in net sales for fiscal 2023.\n\n3. **Reasoning Process**:\n   - The document confirms the goodwill and trade name impairment charges were $1,069.0 million and $950.0 million, respectively, in fiscal 2023.\n   - However, the document indicates that the impairment charges were due to lower future growth rates and operating income margin assumptions, which contradicts the statement's claim of a significant increase in operating income margin.\n   - The document does not provide any information about a 7.0% increase in net sales.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   The statement is refuted because the document indicates that the impairment charges were driven by lower future growth rates and operating income margin assumptions, contradicting the claim of an increase in operating income margin. Additionally, the document does not mention a 7.0% increase in net sales.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

Expansion of muscle biology research\n4. Eligibility for significant milestone payments from collaborations in China and Taiwan\n\n### Step 1: Revenue Improvements\nFirst, let's look for any indications of revenue improvements in the document.\n\n**Paragraph 323:**\n> \"In 2023, we issued 5,016,170 shares of our common stock for net proceeds of $164.2 million pursuant to the Amended ATM Facility.\"\n\n**Paragraph 341:**\n> \"Research and development revenue from Ji Xing for 2023 and 2022 was $1.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively, related to certain development cost reimbursements.\"\n\nThese indicate that the company has been generating revenue through various sources.\n\n**Paragraph 6:**\n> \"As we move toward becoming a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company, we expect to evolve our corporate development strategies to raise capital through a combination of strategic partnerships and equity capital financings to one that is sustained from product generated revenues that are expected to grow over time.\"\n\nThis suggests future revenue growth expectations from product sales and strategic partnerships.\n\n### Step 2: FDA Setbacks\nNext, let's find any mention of FDA setbacks.\n\n**Paragraph 290:**\n> \"Under our strategic alliances with Ji Xing, Ji Xing is responsible for the development of aficamten and omecamtiv mecarbil in China and Taiwan. Clinical development timelines, the likelihood of success and total completion costs vary significantly for each drug candidate and are difficult to estimate.\"\n\nWhile this doesn't directly mention FDA setbacks, it does highlight the challenges and uncertainties in the drug development process.\n\n### Step 3: Expansion of Muscle Biology Research\nNow, let's look for evidence of the expansion of muscle biology research.\n\n**Paragraph 1:**\n> \"Our research continues to drive innovation and leadership in muscle biology. All of our drug candidates have arisen from our cytoskeletal research activities.\"\n\n**Paragraph 8:**\n> \"We expect that we may be able to leverage our expertise in muscle contractility to expand muscle biology research programs related to other areas of muscle function and which may extend to the potential treatment of other serious, yet adjacent, diseases and conditions.\"\n\nThese paragraphs indicate that the company is actively expanding its research in muscle biology.\n\n### Step 4: Eligibility for Significant Milestone Payments from Collaborations in China and Taiwan\nFinally, let's check for eligibility for significant milestone payments from collaborations in China and Taiwan.\n\n**Paragraph 341:**\n> \"We may be eligible to receive from Ji Xing additional payments totaling up to $330.0 million for the achievement of certain commercial milestone events in connection to omecamtiv mecarbil.\"\n\n**Paragraph 341:**\n> \"We may be eligible to receive from Ji Xing milestone payments totaling up to $200.0 million for the achievement of certain development and commercial milestone events in connection to aficamten in the field of oHCM and/or nHCM and other indications.\"\n\nThese indicate that the company is eligible for significant milestone payments from collaborations in China and Taiwan.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the provided financial document, the company has shown revenue improvements, acknowledged the challenges and uncertainties in drug development (which can be linked to potential FDA setbacks), is expanding its muscle biology research, and is eligible for significant milestone payments from collaborations in China and Taiwan.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

            " 1. **Read and Understand the Statement:**\n   The statement claims that Concrete Pumping Holdings, Inc. faced a 24.3% decrease in its U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services revenue in fiscal 2023 due to weak organic growth, and also experienced a slight decrease in gross margin primarily driven by inflationary pressures, particularly in labor.\n\n2. **Analyze the Document:**\n   - From the document:\n     - Paragraph [108]: \"U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services. Revenue for the U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services segment improved by 24.3%, or $12.2 million, from $50.2 million in the twelve months ended October 31, 2022 to $62.4 million for fiscal 2023. The increase was driven by strong organic growth, pricing improvements and the expansion of concrete waste management service offerings.\"\n     - Paragraph [120]: \"Net income for our U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services segment was $14.3 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2023, up from net income of $8.9 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for our U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services segment was $30.0 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2023, up 31.5% from $22.8 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2022. The increase in net income and Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the year-over-year robust organic growth in revenue as discussed above.\"\n\n3. **Document the Reasoning Process:**\n   - The change in revenue for the U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services segment is explicitly stated in the document. The statement claims a 24.3% decrease, but the document indicates a 24.3% increase in revenue attributable to strong organic growth, pricing improvements, and service offerings expansion.\n   - The document mentions inflationary pressures impacting gross margins in the context of the U.S. Concrete Pumping segment (paragraph [118]), but it does not mention any decrease in gross margins specifically for the U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services segment. Instead, it reports increased net income and Adjusted EBITDA for this segment.\n\n4. **Conclude the Analysis:**\n   - The given statement is in direct contradiction with the information provided in the financial document. The document shows an increase rather than a decrease in revenue and does not support the claim of a slight decrease in gross margin for the U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services segment due to inflationary pressures in labor.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n   Therefore, the statement is refuted."

Additionally, the timing of the payment was in February 2024, not 2023.\n\n2. **SEC Civil Enforcement Action:**\n\n   - According to [paragraph id = 341], the Company reached a settlement with the SEC and paid a civil monetary penalty of $11.0 million in October 2023.\n\n   - **Analysis:** The amount mentioned in the document matches the amount in the statement, and the settlement occurred in 2023.\n\n3. **Contractual Settlement with US Bank:**\n\n   - From [paragraph id = 342], it is stated that the Company reached a settlement agreement with Firstar for $2.3 million on May 23, 2023.\n\n   - **Analysis:** The amount and the timing match the details provided in the statement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the provided financial document, the statement that the Company reached a settlement agreement for a Securities Class Action for $20.5 million is not accurate.

However, the settlement amounts of $11 million for the SEC civil enforcement action and $2.3 million for the contractual settlement with US Bank in 2023 are accurate.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

INCOME TAXES\" section, we see:\n   ```\n   Net deferred income tax (assets) liabilities | $ ( 2,283,571 ) | $ ( 488,989 ) |\n   ```\n   This clearly states that the net deferred income tax liability for 2023 is $2,283,571.\n\n2. **Pension Benefit Obligation for 2023:**\n   In paragraph id=226, under the \"10.

In paragraph id=91, it is mentioned:\n   ```\n   The Company expects to make cash contributions of approximately $2,100,000 and $50,000 to our pension and other postretirement plans, respectively, in 2024.\n   ```\n   However, this paragraph mentions expected contributions for 2024, not the actual payments made in 2023. There is no direct mention of the exact amount paid in 2023 in the provided document.\n\nGiven the above points, we can conclude:\n- The net deferred income tax liability for 2023 is indeed $2,283,571.\n- The pension benefit obligation for 2023 is $81,862,011.\n- However, there is no specific mention of pension benefits paid in 2023 being $3,870,701.\n\nSince the statement mentions an exact amount of pension benefits paid in 2023 that cannot be verified with the provided document, the statement is not fully supported by the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

Specifically, the net losses for the nine months ended December 31, 2023, are $(32,348).\n   - The Condensed Statements of Cash Flows ([paragraph id = 7]) indicate negative cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2023, amounting to $(27,427).\n\n   These figures do not indicate positive financial trends or operating profits; instead, they show losses and negative cash flows.\n\n3. **\"...while the management relies on additional funds from the majority shareholder...\"**\n\n   The document mentions management's plan to address the going concern issue:\n   - [paragraph id = 14] \"Management\u2019s plan to alleviate the substantial doubt...include...obtain additional working capital funds from the majority shareholder and President of the Company...\"\n   - [paragraph id = 24] \"Management\u2019s plan to alleviate the substantial doubt...include...obtain additional working capital funds from the majority shareholder and the President of the Company...\"\n\n4. **\"...who previously facilitated a change of control and management team through a stock purchase agreement.\"**\n\n   The document mentions a change of control and management team:\n   - [paragraph id = 8] \"On July 24, 2019, Larison Inc, the principal stockholder...entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement...with Northern Ifurniture Inc...the transaction led to a change of the control and the management team of the Company.\"\n\nNow, let's piece everything together:\n\n- The company indeed faces substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.\n- However, this doubt is due to negative financial trends and operating losses, not positive ones.\n- Management does rely on additional funds from the majority shareholder.\n- The majority shareholder previously facilitated a change of control and management team through a stock purchase agreement.\n\n**Conclusion:** The statement contains a critical inaccuracy regarding the reasons behind the going concern doubt (positive trends and profits vs. negative trends and losses). Therefore, the statement is refuted.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

            " To assess the truthfulness of the given statement based on the provided financial document, we need to analyze the document in detail.\n\n### Step 1: Read the Given Context and the Statement\nThe statement to be verified is:\n\n\"In fiscal 2023, while the COVID-19 pandemic did not materially impact the company's results, there was a significant improvement in revenues due to the reopening of hotels and decreased expenses from corporate items due to compensation, despite permanent closures of some theatres.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Document\nWe need to identify relevant financial data or facts related to the statement.\n\n#### Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\n- **Paragraph 126:** The COVID-19 pandemic had an unprecedented impact on the world and both of our business segments during fiscal 2020, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2022. The extent of these protective actions and their impact on our businesses dissipated throughout fiscal 2022.\n\n#### Improvement in Revenues and Operating Income\n- **Paragraph 172:** Revenues, operating income, net earnings (loss) attributable to The Marcus Corporation and net earnings (loss) per diluted common share improved significantly during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022.\n- **Paragraph 189:** Theatre division revenues and operating income increased significantly during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 as customers continued to return to theatres and attendance grew as an increased number of films were released to movie theatres during fiscal 2023.\n- **Paragraph 208:** Total revenues before cost reimbursements increased 6.3% during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. All of our company-owned hotels and resorts contributed to the improved revenue during fiscal 2023.\n\n#### Expenses and Closures\n- **Paragraph 174:** Our operating income during fiscal 2023 was negatively impacted by impairment charges of approximately $1.1 million related to two permanently closed theatres and surplus real estate that we intend to sell.\n- **Paragraph 229:** Non-cash impairment charges related to two permanently closed theatres and surplus theatre real estate in fiscal 2023.\n\n### Step 3: Document Each Step of the Reasoning Process\n1. The document clearly states that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's businesses dissipated throughout fiscal 2022, which implies that it did not materially impact the company's results in fiscal 2023.\n2. Revenues and operating income improved significantly in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due to increased theatre attendance and improved hotel and resort revenues.\n3. There is no mention of decreased expenses from corporate items due to compensation in the document.\n4. The document mentions impairment charges due to the permanent closure of some theatres, which supports the part of the statement about the closures.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe statement is partially supported by the document. While the document confirms that the COVID-19 pandemic did not materially impact the company's results in fiscal 2023 and that there was a significant improvement in revenues due to the reopening of hotels and increased theatre attendance, it does not mention decreased expenses from corporate items due to compensation. Additionally, the document confirms the permanent closures of some theatres.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

The statement mentions the company's fleet strategy, revenue structure, and market competition.\n\n2. **Analyze the Document for Relevant Data**:\n   - **Fleet Management**: The document mentions active management of fleet size through opportunistic acquisitions and dispositions (paragraph 2).\n   - **Revenue Structure**: The document describes revenue sources, such as time charters and spot market operations, and their sensitivity to market conditions (paragraphs 5, 6, 12, 127, 130, 161).\n   - **Market Conditions**: The document discusses market volatility, U.S. economic factors, and competition from international transportation options (paragraphs 6, 128).\n\n3. **Detailed Reasoning**:\n   - **Opportunistic Acquisitions and Dispositions**: Paragraph 2 explicitly states that the company engages in \"opportunistic acquisitions and dispositions of vessels\" to enhance the return on invested capital.\n   - **Fixed Rates and Revenue Structure**: Paragraphs 12, 127, and 130 mention that the majority of the company's revenues come from time charters, which provide predictable income but are subject to market conditions.

            " Sure, let's analyze the provided financial document step-by-step to verify the statement.\n\n### 1. Investment in Information Technology\n**Analysis:**\n- The statement mentions that the company invested significantly in information technology to support its talent solutions initiatives.\n- **Paragraph id = 154:** \"The year-over-year increase from 2022 to 2023 in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to $292.2 million used for acquisitions in 2023 ... capital expenditures were $103.7 million, $75.8 million and $53.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\"\n  - This indicates that there was a significant increase in capital expenditures from 2022 to 2023, which corresponds to increased investment.\n\n### 2. Negative Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n**Analysis:**\n- The statement mentions that the investment contributed to a negative cash flow from investing activities.\n- **Paragraph id = 154:** \"Net cash used in investing activities for 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $412.5 million, $170.7 million and $107.4 million, respectively.\"\n  - This shows a net outflow of $412.5 million in 2023, which is a significant negative cash flow from investing activities.\n\n### 3. Accelerated Share Repurchase\n**Analysis:**\n- The statement mentions an accelerated share repurchase funded by borrowing from a Senior Credit Facility.\n- **Paragraph id = 151:** \"Under the repurchase program, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (\u201cASR\u201d) agreement with a counterparty on May 8, 2023 to repurchase $200.0 million of our outstanding common stock and received an initial delivery of 1.8 million shares. On August 10, 2023, we received an additional 0.3 million shares of our common stock upon settlement of the ASR agreement. The ASR was funded through borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility.\"\n  - This confirms that the company executed an ASR and funded it through the Senior Credit Facility.\n\n### 4. Increase in Senior Credit Facility to $750 Million\n**Analysis:**\n- The statement mentions that the Senior Credit Facility was increased to $750 million.\n- **Paragraph id = 149:** \"As of December 31, 2023, (1) $460.0 million was drawn with $269.2 million of available credit under the Senior Credit Facility (as defined below), (2) the aggregate principal amount of our 2027 Notes (as defined below) outstanding was $500.0 million, and (3) the aggregate principal amount of our 2029 Notes (as defined below) outstanding was $350.0 million.\"\n  - This paragraph does not explicitly state the total limit of the Senior Credit Facility but indicates usage and availability. We need to infer from the provided data.\n  - Considering the total credit facility includes $460.0 million drawn + $269.2 million available, there was a total of $729.2 million in credit capacity as of December 31, 2023. This is close to $750 million but not a precise confirmation.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe statement is mostly corroborated by the financial document, except for the precise increase of the Senior Credit Facility to $750 million, which is not explicitly stated but can be inferred to be around that amount based on the sum of drawn and available credit.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

Adjusted EBITDA also improved from -$2,432,000 to -$881,000 for the same period.

This part of the statement is also true.\n\n3. **Driven primarily by increases in working capital requirements:**\n   - Paragraph 107 states that the primary usages of cash for the six months ended December 31, 2023, were the net loss and increases in accounts receivable, and other assets, which are working capital requirements. So, this part of the statement is true.\n\n4. **Interest expenses:**\n   - Paragraph 98 shows that interest expense increased by $139,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022.

Therefore, the statement is not entirely entailed by the document.\n\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, the statement is refuted."

However, the document does not support the reduction in partner compensation from 25% to 20%.\n\nTherefore, the provided statement is partially refuted due to the lack of explicit confirmation regarding the percentage change in partner compensation.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

Here are the steps to conduct this analysis:\n\n1. **Inventory Balance Decrease in 2023:**\n   - **Document Insight:** \"[paragraph id = 181] As of December 31, 2023, our inventory provisions reduced gross inventory by $23.3 million compared to $29.4 million as of December 31, 2022. The level of estimated excess inventory as of December 31, 2023 decreased reflecting the use of our outlet stores and temporary clearance locations to profitably clear excess merchandise.\"\n   - **Analysis:** The document confirms a decrease in inventory provisions for 2023 and the use of outlet stores and temporary clearance locations to clear excess merchandise, matching part of the statement.\n\n2. **Strategic Reduction in Inventory Purchases:**\n   - **Document Insight:** None explicitly mentioned a strategic reduction in inventory purchases for the Spring and Fall seasons. However, the reduction in inventory levels is mentioned generally.\n   - **Analysis:** There\u2019s no direct mention of \"Spring and Fall seasons\" regarding the reduction in inventory purchases. As such, this specific part of the statement cannot be verified by the document.\n\n3. **Wholesale Customer Base:**\n   - **Document Insight:** \"[paragraph id = 22] In 2023, our four largest LAAP wholesale customers accounted for approximately 15% of LAAP net sales, and were less than 10% individually. As of December 31, 2023, we directly operated 248 retail stores, and third-parties operated 27 concession and 47 franchise based stores... nearly 350 wholesale customers, including distributors, in LAAP.\"\n   - **Analysis:** The document specifies nearly 350 wholesale customers in LAAP but does not mention the number of wholesale customers in the U.S.\n\n4. **U.S. Wholesale Customer Base:**\n   - **Document Insight:** No specific mention of 1,850 customers in the U.S.\n   - **Analysis:** The absence of a specific number for U.S. wholesale customers refutes the part of the statement claiming 1,850 wholesale customers in the U.S.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the provided financial document, the statement that Columbia Sportswear's inventory balance decreased significantly in 2023 is confirmed, as is the use of outlet stores and temporary clearance locations to clear excess merchandise. However, the statement lacks support for the specific details about a strategic reduction in inventory purchases for the Spring and Fall seasons and the U.S. wholesale customer base of 1,850.\n\n**Final determination:**\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

Paragraph [132] confirms these values, stating that $23.0 million was paid for the SEMTH Acquisition and $20.1 million for the Tredegar Acquisition.\n\n   So, the total acquisition cost in 2023 is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\$23.0 \\text{ million (SEMTH)} + \\$20.1 \\text{ million (Tredegar)} = \\$43.1 \\text{ million}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Strategic Restructuring in 2022**:\n   - **Discontinued Businesses**: Paragraph [105] mentions that the sale of legacy operations, including the Drivetrain and XL Grid businesses, was completed in January 2023.

This discrepancy is critical, as the provided document places these actions in 2023, not 2022.\n\n4. **Impact on Cash Flows**:\n   - According to paragraph [132], the net cash used in continuing investing activities in 2023 was $17.1 million, primarily relating to the cash paid for acquisitions, confirming the impact on cash flows.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The statement accurately reflects the total acquisition cost of $43.1 million in 2023.\n   - However, the statement incorrectly attributes the discontinuation of certain businesses to 2022, whereas the document states these actions occurred in January 2023.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

Qurate Retail experiences potential economic losses due to foreign currency fluctuations which would have impacted QVC's Adjusted OIBDA across 2021 to 2023.\n2. Qurate Retail manages interest rate risks using derivatives to offset variations in its mixed debt structure.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Foreign Currency Fluctuations Impact on Adjusted OIBDA**\n\n- **Paragraph [75-76]**: These sections discuss currency exchange rate fluctuations and their impact on financial statements. Specifically, it mentions that QVC's reported Adjusted OIBDA for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 would have been impacted by approximately $3 million, $4 million, and $6 million, respectively, for every 1% change in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that Qurate Retail experiences potential economic losses due to foreign currency fluctuations which would have impacted QVC's Adjusted OIBDA across 2021 to 2023.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Management of Interest Rate Risks Using Derivatives**\n\n- **Paragraph [75-76]**: These sections also mention the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, it states, \"We periodically assess the effectiveness of our derivative financial instruments. With regard to interest rate swaps, we monitor the fair value of interest rate swaps as well as the effective interest rate the interest rate swap yields, in comparison to historical interest rate trends. We believe that any losses incurred with regard to interest rate swaps would be largely offset by the effects of interest rate movements on the underlying debt facilities.\"\n\nThis confirms that Qurate Retail manages interest rate risks using derivatives to offset variations in its mixed debt structure.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the provided financial document, both claims in the statement are supported:\n1. Qurate Retail experiences potential economic losses due to foreign currency fluctuations which would have impacted QVC's Adjusted OIBDA across 2021 to 2023.\n2. Qurate Retail manages interest rate risks using derivatives to offset variations in its mixed debt structure.\n\nTherefore, the statement is entailed."

However, the document does not provide the net sales for the segment in paragraph id = 170, so we cannot accurately calculate the gross profit margin.\n\n   Given the information provided, we cannot confirm the gross profit margin of 6.6%. Additionally, the document mentions restructuring costs but does not specify the total amount for all segments as $54 million.\n\nConclusion:\n- The statement about net sales and net sales increase is accurate.\n- The statement about the gross profit margin cannot be verified due to insufficient data.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

            " Sure, let's analyze the provided financial document to determine if the statement is entailed or refuted.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Analyzing the Document\n1. **Paragraph 8 and 232**:\n   - These paragraphs discuss the terms and amendments of the Business Combination Agreement (BCA), including the exchange of shares and other financial details. However, they do not mention the obligations regarding business operations or minimum tangible assets.\n\n2. **Paragraph 10 and 233**:\n   - These paragraphs cover the deemed value of Purchaser Shares and the adjustments that may apply to the Exchange Consideration. They do not provide information about the operating obligations or asset requirements at Closing.\n\n3. **Paragraph 12**:\n   - This paragraph explicitly mentions the customary representations and warranties, including obligations to operate businesses in the ordinary course and refrain from competing transactions. It also specifies that these covenants generally do not survive the Closing, except for certain exceptions.\n\n4. **Paragraph 13**:\n   - Paragraph 13 lists the closing conditions, including:\n     - **(viii) \"the Purchaser having at least $5,000,001 in tangible net assets upon the Closing\"**.\n   - This requirement directly supports part of the statement regarding the minimum tangible net assets.\n\n5. **Paragraph 14**:\n   - This paragraph discusses the terms under which the BCA can be terminated, including the breach of representations and warranties. It does not contain additional information relevant to the statement's validity.\n\n6. **Paragraph 293**:\n   - This paragraph discusses a potential BCA Amendment No. 3 but does not provide information about operating obligations or asset requirements at Closing.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe statement to verify includes three main points:\n1. **Obligations for the Parties to operate their businesses in the ordinary course**: This is supported by Paragraph 12.\n2. **Not engage in competing transactions prior to Closing, with the covenants and representations generally not surviving the Closing except for certain exceptions**: This is also supported by Paragraph 12.\n3. **Requirement that the Purchaser holds at least $5,000,001 in tangible net assets upon Closing**: This is supported by Paragraph 13.\n\nThus, all parts of the statement are supported by the provided financial document.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

However, it misleads in saying the company maintained its cash balance through loans and financing activities, as the cash balance actually decreased.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is partly true but since the financial document shows a decline in the cash position, the statement is refuted.**\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

            " ### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Reading the Statement and the Context:**\n   - **Statement:** Despite a net loss of $34,529 for 2023, Zomedica Corp. increased its additional paid-in capital to $29,929 and integrated the QBT operations into its ERP system to enhance internal controls, addressing a material weakness.\n   - **Document:** The document provided is a detailed financial report of Zomedica Corp., including various transactions, business activities, and notes on financial statements.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Financial Data:**\n   - **Net Loss for 2023:** The statement mentions a net loss of $34,529 for 2023. However, there is no explicit mention of a $34,529 net loss in the provided document. We should look for any reported net loss figures.\n   - **Additional Paid-in Capital:** The statement mentions an increase in additional paid-in capital to $29,929. We need to confirm this figure in the financial statements.\n   - **Integration of QBT Operations:** The statement mentions the integration of QBT operations into the ERP system. We need to verify this integration and its impact on internal controls.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Financial Document:**\n   - **Net Loss for 2023:** The provided financial document does not explicitly state a net loss of $34,529 for 2023. Without this specific figure, we cannot confirm the net loss part of the statement.\n   - **Additional Paid-in Capital:** The document does not provide a figure for additional paid-in capital. Therefore, we cannot confirm the increase to $29,929.\n   - **Integration of QBT Operations:** Paragraph id = 36 mentions the integration of QBT operations into the ERP system.\n     - **Excerpt:** \"With the acquisition of QBT, and as of December 31, 2023, the Company has retained approximately 40 employees who hold roles and responsibilities consistent with those of the employees within the Georgia manufacturing and distribution facility. The Company has integrated the QBT operations into its current ERP system, along with corresponding workflows, for internal control actions.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - **Net Loss for 2023:** The statement regarding a net loss of $34,529 for 2023 cannot be verified due to the absence of this specific figure in the provided document.\n   - **Additional Paid-in Capital:** The statement regarding an increase in additional paid-in capital to $29,929 cannot be verified due to the absence of this figure in the provided document.\n   - **Integration of QBT Operations:** The statement regarding the integration of QBT operations into the ERP system is confirmed by the document.\n\n### Final Determination\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted because the financial document does not support the figures for the net loss and additional paid-in capital. The integration of QBT operations is the only part of the statement that is supported by the document.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

The Hemisphere can easily be mounted to a variety of surfaces or objects and has 3 cameras that provide up to 210-degrees of eye-level, high-definition video, a strobe light, automatic license plate recognition, facial recognition (optional), automated broadcast announcements, and intercom capability running on a wired or wireless network.

FedRAMP is a government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. FedRAMP compliance is one of the factors that enables Knightscope to do business with federal agencies. This achievement means that Knightscope can be listed on the FedRAMP Marketplace as an approved provider for federal agencies as a next step and can also begin its deployment processes to perform on the contract awarded by the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (the \u201cVA\u201d) for its first K5 GOV.

The increase during the three months ended March 31, 2024 when compared with the prior year period was primarily due to an increase in origination volumes resulting from higher closings within Homebuilding and improved capture rates.\"\n   - The statement mentions that Financial Services revenues increased by 59%, which matches the document.

The document attributes the increase in Financial Services revenues to higher closings within Homebuilding as a whole, not specifically to Texas.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The part of the statement regarding Texas home sale revenues is entailed by the document.\n- The part of the statement regarding Financial Services revenues being primarily linked to higher closings specifically in Texas is not explicitly supported by the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

The statement consists of four specific claims:\n\n1. **On January 31, 2023, Pono Capital Two entered into a Merger Agreement to merge with SBC Medical Group.**\n2. **The purchase price for a Note was adjusted to $2,700,000 in February 2024.**\n3. **The consumption of proceeds for a business combination was supported by the initial public offering on August 9, 2022.**\n4. **The initial public offering generated $115 million.**\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each claim step by step:\n\n#### Claim 1: On January 31, 2023, Pono Capital Two entered into a Merger Agreement to merge with SBC Medical Group.\n- According to paragraph id=10, \"On January 31, 2023, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d), by and among us, Pono Two Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d), SBC Medical Group Holdings Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (\u201cSBC\u201d), Mehana Capital, LLC, in its capacity as Purchaser Representative, and Yoshiyuki Aikawa, in his capacity as Seller Representative.\" This corresponds with the given statement.\n\n#### Claim 2: The purchase price for a Note was adjusted to $2,700,000 in February 2024.\n- According to paragraph id=190, \"On February 27, 2024, the Company and SBC entered into an Amendment to the Note Purchase Agreement (the \u201cAmended Note Purchase Agreement\u201d), which increased the purchase price of the Note from $1,000,000 to $2,700,000.\" This supports the given statement.\n\n#### Claim 3: The consumption of proceeds for a business combination was supported by the initial public offering on August 9, 2022.\n- The document does not provide explicit information regarding the initial public offering date or the use of proceeds from it for the business combination. Therefore, we cannot verify this part of the statement based on the provided document.\n\n#### Claim 4: The initial public offering generated $115 million.\n- Again, the document does not provide explicit information regarding the initial public offering's proceeds. Thus, we cannot verify this part of the statement either.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the provided financial document, the first two claims (entering into a Merger Agreement on January 31, 2023, and the adjustment of the purchase price for a Note to $2,700,000 in February 2024) are supported. However, the document does not provide information regarding the initial public offering date or the proceeds generated, making it impossible to verify the last two claims.\n\nTherefore, the statement is partially supported but cannot be fully verified due to missing information regarding the initial public offering. As such, it is entailed for the parts that can be confirmed but overall, it cannot be conclusively entailed or refuted. Hence, the evaluation leans towards refuted due to incomplete information.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

            " Sure, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Context Information**:\n   - The document mentions that the U.K. Operations segment includes concrete pumping services (Camfaud and Premier Concrete Pumping brands) and concrete waste management services (Eco-Pan).\n   - It explicitly states that the Eco-Pan business in the U.K. operates from a shared Camfaud location (paragraph id 8 and 99).\n\n2. **Revenue Recognition Standards**:\n   - The document details how the company recognizes revenue for its concrete waste services under two standards: ASC 606 for disposal services and ASC 842 for lease revenue (paragraph id 198).\n   - It is mentioned that \"Almost all contracts include two prices: (1) A fixed price that includes (a) the pickup and disposal of the waste material and (b) a specified number of days the customer can use the pan and (2) a daily rental price if the customer keeps the pan for a time period in excess of days permitted in the fixed price.\"\n\n3. **Emphasis on ASC 606**:\n   - The statement mentions that ASC 606 services are the main component of the fiscal year revenue ending October 31, 2023. While the document does not provide a direct percentage breakdown between ASC 606 and ASC 842 for the U.K. specifically, it does explain the performance obligations and revenue recognition methods in detail.\n   - The document clearly outlines that revenue from the daily usage (lease) of pans is recognized under ASC 842 while the disposal services are recognized under ASC 606.\n\n4. **Analysis**:\n   - The statement correctly identifies that the U.K. concrete waste services operate from a shared Camfaud location.\n   - It is also accurate that the revenue is recognized under ASC 606 for disposal services and ASC 842 for daily usage fees.\n   - However, the document does not provide specific data on whether ASC 606 services are the main component of the fiscal year revenue for the U.K. segment specifically. Given the detailed description of the dual pricing structure, it is reasonable to assume both components are significant, although the exact proportion is not explicitly stated.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nGiven the provided information, the statement is partially supported. The parts about the shared Camfaud location and the revenue recognition methods under ASC 606 and ASC 842 are correct. However, the statement that ASC 606 services are the main component of the fiscal year revenue is not explicitly backed by the document. Therefore, this part of the statement cannot be fully verified or refuted based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** based on the lack of explicit evidence to support the claim that ASC 606 services are the main component of the fiscal year revenue."

This implies a significant impact on net income.\n\n4. **Self-Insurance Liabilities**:\n   - The document does not directly mention \"substantial self-insurance liabilities.\" However, paragraph 326 discusses outstanding payment obligations under a program amounting to $11.8 million, but this is not explicitly related to self-insurance.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The document clearly supports the statement regarding the significant goodwill impairment charge related to the Family Dollar segment in fiscal 2023 and its substantial impact on net income.\n- However, the document does not explicitly mention or support the part of the statement about managing substantial self-insurance liabilities.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

Experienced a decrease in net loss by 202%.\n2. Recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $198.8 million.\n3. Had total operating expenses increase by 136%, primarily due to restructuring and other charges.\n\n**Financial Document Analysis:**\n\n**1. Change in Net Loss:**\n- The net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2023, was $277,976,000.\n- The net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2022, was $91,961,000.\n\nCalculation for the change in net loss:\n\\[ \\text{Change in Net Loss} = \\left( \\frac{277,976,000 - 91,961,000}{91,961,000} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 202\\% \\]\n\n**2. Goodwill Impairment Charge:**\n- The document states: \"The Company recognized a non-cash, pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $198.8 million during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2023.\" (Paragraph id = 71)\n\n**3. Total Operating Expenses:**\n- Total operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2023, were $301,146,000.\n- Total operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022, were $127,851,000.\n\nCalculation for the change in total operating expenses:\n\\[ \\text{Change in Total Operating Expenses} = \\left( \\frac{301,146,000 - 127,851,000}{127,851,000} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 136\\% \\]\n\n**4. Restructuring and Other Charges:**\n- Restructuring and other charges for the three months ended December 31, 2023, were $1,497,000.\n- There were no restructuring and other charges for the three months ended December 31, 2022.\n\nHowever, the increase in total operating expenses primarily due to restructuring and other charges is not clearly supported by the document. The significant increase in goodwill impairment ($198.8 million) seems to be the primary factor driving the increase in total operating expenses, not the restructuring and other charges.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the statement about the decrease in net loss by 202% and the recording of a goodwill impairment charge of $198.8 million is supported by the document. However, the statement that the increase in total operating expenses is primarily due to restructuring and other charges is refuted by the document. The primary factor for the increase in total operating expenses is the goodwill impairment charge.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

Facing challenges in its financial condition due to reduced revenues and operational losses.\n3. Efforts to reduce advertising and development costs.\n\n### Step 1: Increased Competition\n\nExtract from Document:\n- [paragraph id = 41] Competition: \"We operate in a highly competitive environment. Although, we believe that our Blackbox System is the only platform that has successfully merged a comprehensive analytics system or \u201cscanner\u201d and a social media platform within the same \u201cdashboard\u201d allowing members to view the same real-time data in parallel, there are a number of companies that offer one or more features that are similar to or attempt to address the same market as we do. Some of these competitors have financial and other resources that are significantly greater than ours. The greatest amount of competition exists within products that provide trading analytics often referred to as \u201cscanners\u201d. We compete with these entities based on a number of factors including price, ease of use, standard features and proprietary features (if applicable). Ultimately, we believe the primary factor used in evaluating the trading analytics by any platform is the user\u2019s ability to derive actionable information from that platform.

            " To assess the truthfulness of the given statement, we need to analyze the provided financial document paragraphs. The statement has two main parts:\n\n1. **Potential conflicts of interest due to ownership of founder shares:**\n   - Paragraph 22 discusses potential conflicts of interest involving the management team and board of directors who may own founder shares and/or Private Placement Units. It specifically mentions that \"because the founder shares were purchased at approximately $0.012 per share, the holders of our founder shares (including our management team that directly or indirectly own founder shares) could make a substantial profit after our initial business combination even if our public shareholders lose money.\" This clearly indicates a potential conflict of interest.\n\n2. **Redemption rights for public shareholders with a restriction on redeeming more than 15% of shares sold in the IPO:**\n   - Paragraph 26 details the limitation on redemption upon completion of the initial business combination if shareholder approval is sought. It explicitly states, \"our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person ... will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the IPO, which we refer to as 'Excess Shares,' without our prior consent.\" This confirms the restriction mentioned in the statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Conflict of Interest Due to Founder Shares:**\n   - The statement mentions potential conflicts of interest due to ownership of founder shares by the management team.\n   - Paragraph 22 confirms that members of the management team and board of directors may own founder shares and also mentions specific conditions under which conflicts of interest could arise.\n\n2. **Redemption Rights and the 15% Restriction:**\n   - The statement mentions a restriction on public shareholders redeeming more than 15% of the shares sold in the IPO.\n   - Paragraph 26 clearly outlines this restriction, stating that public shareholders will be restricted from redeeming their shares beyond 15% of the shares sold in the IPO without prior consent of the company.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the provided financial document, both parts of the statement are supported by the document.

            " 1. **Marketing Expenses:**\n   - The given statement claims that marketing expenses increased by 40.4%.\n   - However, the financial document does not provide a specific percentage increase for marketing expenses. It only mentions that the cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased due primarily to increased property tax expense and marketing expense (paragraphs 76 and 176).\n   - Since there is no specific mention of a 40.4% increase in marketing expenses, this part of the statement cannot be confirmed from the provided document.\n\n2. **Property of Tomorrow Program:**\n   - The statement mentions significant capital expenditures as part of the Property of Tomorrow program.\n   - The document confirms that the company spent approximately $25 million on this program in the three months ended March 31, 2024, and expects to spend approximately $150 million over 2024 (paragraphs 72 and 172).\n   - Therefore, the part of the statement regarding the Property of Tomorrow program is supported by the document.\n\n3. **Net Operating Income from Newly Acquired Facilities:**\n   - The statement claims continued generation of net operating income from newly acquired facilities.\n   - The document confirms that combined net operating income generated by Acquired Facilities and Newly Developed and Expanded Facilities increased by 82.7% ($32.5 million) during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 (paragraphs 70 and 170).\n   - Therefore, the part of the statement regarding net operating income from newly acquired facilities is supported by the document.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement mentions three key points: a 40.4% increase in marketing expenses, significant capital expenditures as part of the Property of Tomorrow program, and continued generation of net operating income from newly acquired facilities. While the document supports the second and third points, it does not provide specific information to confirm the first point regarding a 40.4% increase in marketing expenses.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

            " To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to check various parts of the document for relevant financial data and facts related to it. The key points we need to verify include:\n\n1. Clarus Corporation\u2019s comprehensive loss in 2023.\n2. Influence of a net loss of $10,146 thousand.\n3. Influence of a foreign currency translation adjustment gain of $2,405 thousand.\n4. The effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting as per the unqualified opinion from the independent registered public accounting firm.\n\nLet's go through the document to find these points.\n\n### 1. Comprehensive Loss in 2023\nTo confirm the comprehensive loss, we need to look for the \"Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income - Years Ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\"\n\n### 2. Net Loss in 2023\nSimilarly, the net loss for the year 2023 should be mentioned in the same \"Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income.\"\n\n### 3. Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment Gain\nThe foreign currency translation adjustment gain may be found in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" under \"Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation.\"\n\n### 4. Effectiveness of Internal Controls\nThe opinion on internal controls over financial reporting should be found in the \"Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.\"\n\n### Review of the Document\n\n#### Comprehensive Loss in 2023\n[**Paragraph ID = 70** lists the location details of financial statements, we need to check \"Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income\u201d for December 31, 2023, on page 59. However, the specific numbers are not visible in the provided document excerpts.\n\n#### Net Loss in 2023\n[**Paragraph ID = 70**: \"...the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income...\"]. As above, the specific numerical data is not directly visible from the presented text; we should refer to actual financial statements on page 59.\n\n#### Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment Gain\n[**Paragraph ID = 77**: \"Foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.\"]. The exact numerical value of the foreign currency translation adjustment gain is not specified in the text provided.\n\n#### Effectiveness of Internal Controls\n[**Paragraph ID = 117**]: \"... effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023...\" This confirms the point about internal controls.\n\n### Documentation\nSince the document does not provide the 'Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income', we cannot view the specific figures for comprehensive loss, net loss, or foreign currency translation adjustment gain.\n\nTherefore, based on the incomplete information from the given text, we cannot fully verify that the comprehensive loss in 2023 was influenced by a net loss of $10,146 thousand and a foreign currency translation adjustment gain of $2,405 thousand.\n\n### Final Determination\nBased on the available document excerpts, we can conclude that the statement regarding the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting is entailed by the document. However, the specific financial numbers supporting comprehensive loss, net loss, and foreign currency translation adjustment gain could not be verified due to missing details. Therefore, for those specific numbers, the statement is not fully verifiable from the provided text.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted due to the lack of sufficient numerical details supporting the comprehensive loss, net loss, and foreign currency translation adjustment gain.**"

There were significant legal settlements.\n\n**Step 1: Check the net loss in Q4 2023**\n- From the \"Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income\", we see that the net income (loss) for the three months ended December 31, 2023, is $(277,946).\n\n**Step 2: Check the working capital increase**\n- Working capital is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities. However, the provided document does not have a separate statement of current assets and liabilities. Instead, let's look at the cash flow statement to see if there's an increase in cash and cash equivalents.\n- From the \"Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\", the cash at the end of the period on December 31, 2023, is $17,963,261, and cash at the beginning of the period is $18,165,168. This shows a decrease in cash, which is a component of working capital. Without the complete picture of current assets and liabilities, we cannot conclusively determine the change in working capital.\n\n**Step 3: Check significant legal settlements**\n- From \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" (paragraph id = 40) and \"PART II-OTHER INFORMATION - ITEM 1 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\", the company settled three legal cases for approximately $203,000 and accrued a liability of approximately $270,000 for pending cases. These are significant settlements.\n\nBased on the provided document:\n1. The net loss in Q4 2023 is confirmed as $277,946.\n2. We cannot confirm the working capital increase due to insufficient data.\n3. Significant legal settlements are confirmed.\n\n**Conclusion**: The statement claiming an increase in working capital cannot be confirmed due to insufficient information. However, the net loss and significant legal settlements are accurate. Therefore, the statement is **refuted** based on the available data."

It also describes various safety and environmental stewardship measures (paragraph 31).\n   - This indicates that OSG has robust safety and environmental standards.\n\n2. **Potential Financial Impacts from New Regulatory Requirements**:\n   - Paragraph 32 states that OSG cannot predict the cost of complying with future regulatory requirements and these could result in substantial additional costs.\n   - Paragraph 68 mentions that OSG may incur substantial costs or be required to take its vessels out of service due to future regulatory requirements and market conditions may not justify such expenditures or permit profitable operations.\n\n3. **Changes in the Jones Act**:\n   - The statement mentions \"potential changes in the Jones Act.\" However, there is no explicit mention of the Jones Act in the given document.\n   - The Jones Act is a U.S. federal law that regulates maritime commerce and it is not specifically discussed or referenced in the provided paragraphs.\n\n### Analysis of the Statement\n\n- **Robust Safety and Environmental Standards**:\n   - The document confirms OSG's commitment to safety and environmental standards.\n\n- **Potential Financial Impacts from New Regulatory Requirements**:\n   - The document supports the idea that OSG faces potential financial impacts from new regulatory requirements.\n\n- **Potential Changes in the Jones Act**:\n   - The document does not mention the Jones Act or any potential changes to it.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe statement about robust safety and environmental standards and potential financial impacts from new regulatory requirements is supported by the document. However, the statement's reference to potential changes in the Jones Act is not mentioned in the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** because the document does not support the claim about potential changes in the Jones Act.\n\n### Final Determination:\n\"Therefore, the statement is refuted.\""

Verify the redemption amount and the date by which these redemptions occurred.\n3. Confirm the number of Class A Ordinary Shares outstanding after redemptions and conversions.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Amount in Trust Account\nFrom [paragraph id = 7]:\n- Following the closing of the IPO (including the closing of the Over-Allotment Option), an aggregate amount of $227,250,000 was placed in the company\u2019s trust account.\n\nFrom [paragraph id = 34]:\n- The underwriter exercised the over-allotment option for 2,500,000 additional units, generating gross proceeds of $25,000,000.\n\nTherefore, the initial amount in the trust account is confirmed as $227,250,000.\n\n### Step 2: Aggregate Redemption Amount\nFrom [paragraph id = 73]:\n- The balance sheet shows a redemption amount of $211,918,105 for Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption at December 31, 2022.\n\nFrom the statement, the date should be June 15, 2023.

We only have the year-end balance sheet data for December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2023.\n\n### Step 3: Number of Class A Ordinary Shares Outstanding\nFrom [paragraph id = 55]:\n- As of March 1, 2024, there were 7,871,910 ordinary shares outstanding, of which 5,621,910 were Class A ordinary shares.\n\nFrom [paragraph id = 73]:\n- The balance sheet shows a redemption of Class A Ordinary Shares amounting to approximately $211,918,105 with a redemption value of $10.80 per share as of December 31, 2023.\n\nGiven the redemption value and the number of shares, the calculation matches the reduction in the number of Class A Ordinary Shares.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe initial amount in the trust account is confirmed as $227,250,000, including the over-allotment option. The aggregate redemption amount of approximately $211,918,105 by December 31, 2022, is confirmed.

However, this total aggregate value includes all options, not just those granted to Nate Knight.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the given information, the value of Nate Knight's options cannot be directly verified from the document as provided.

This is relevant as the statement mentions the investment in Circle.\n   - There were no other substantial investments in entities outside of JW Marriott Hill Country and OEG in 2023 as per the document.\n\n3. **Sum up cash payments for purchase-related liabilities:**\n\n   - JW Marriott Hill Country:\n     - Total purchase price: $800 million\n     - Funding:\n       - $395 million from equity offering\n       - $393 million from senior notes\n       - The remaining amount from cash on hand\n\n   To directly use the relevant information without breaking down the funding sources further:\n   - JW Marriott Hill Country total payment: $800 million (entire purchase price considered as immediate cash payment)\n\n   - Investment in Circle (via OEG):\n     - $296 million for 30% equity sale in OEG\n\n4. **Total cash payments for both acquisitions:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{JW Marriott Hill Country} = \\$800 \\text{ million}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Investment in Circle} = \\$296 \\text{ million}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cash payments} = \\$800 \\text{ million} + \\$296 \\text{ million} = \\$1,096 \\text{ million}\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe statement claiming that the \"total cash payments for purchase-related liabilities in 2023 equaled $601,000\" is incorrect.

We need to verify this value.\n\n3. **Check Specific Components of Interest Expense**:\n   - The statement mentions $3.9 million arising from promissory notes and $560,000 from the construction loan.\n\n4. **Compare with Provided Data**:\n   - Paragraph 77: Interest expense increased by $529,000, which does not directly provide the total interest expense but indicates an increase.\n   - We do not have direct data from the document that confirms the total interest expense of $4.46 million or its breakdown into $3.9 million from promissory notes and $560,000 from the construction loan.\n\n5. **Check Revenue Data**:\n   - The statement mentions that the interest expense comprises 5.7% of total revenue. We need to verify the revenue for the period ending December 31, 2023, from the document.\n\n6. **Reference to Total Occupancy Costs**:\n   - From paragraph 77: \"Our total occupancy costs, defined as the sum of operating lease expense and interest expense, were $6.0 million and $5.4 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\"\n   - This does not directly provide the interest expense but includes it as part of total occupancy costs.\n\nGiven the document does not directly state the total interest expense for the period ending December 31, 2023, nor does it provide a clear breakdown of components specifically matching the statement, we cannot confirm the figures provided in the statement based on the document.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

            " 1. **Examine the Financial Data on Related Party Loans:**\n   - In paragraph [263], it states for 2023, \"proceeds from a related party working capital loan of $1,811,900.\"\n   - In paragraph [264], it states for 2022, \"proceeds from a related party working capital loan of $2,800,209.\"\n\n   Clearly, there is an error here because the values are swapped between the years. The correct values are:\n   - For 2023, proceeds from a related party working capital loan is $1,811,900.\n   - For 2022, proceeds from a related party working capital loan is $2,800,209.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Loans from Related Parties:**\n   - We need to confirm that the liquidity from related party loans provided a total of $2,800,209 in 2023 and $1,811,900 in 2022.\n\n   Given the corrected values:\n   - For 2023: $1,811,900.\n   - For 2022: $2,800,209.\n\n   However, there is a mistake in the statement. Correcting it:\n   - For 2023: $1,811,900.\n   - For 2022: $2,800,209.\n\n3. **Total Net Cash Used in Financing Activities:**\n   - From paragraph [263], net cash used in financing activities for 2023: $3,293,439.\n   - From paragraph [264], net cash used in financing activities for 2022: $97,344,635.\n\n   The total net cash used in financing activities for both years is:\n   \\[\n   \\$3,293,439 + \\$97,344,635 = \\$100,638,074\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Percentage Contribution:**\n   - Sum of loans for 2023 and 2022:\n   \\[\n   \\$1,811,900 + \\$2,800,209 = \\$4,612,109\n   \\]\n\n   - The percentage contribution of related party loans to total net cash used in financing activities:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\$4,612,109}{\\$100,638,074} \\times 100 \\approx 4.58\\%\n   \\]\n\n   The values given in the statement are incorrect; hence the percentage calculated from the financial document is significantly different from the stated 19.79%.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement \"The liquidity from related party loans provided a total of $2,800,209 in 2023 and $1,811,900 in 2022, which constitutes approximately 19.79% of the total net cash used in financing activities for these years combined.\" is refuted by the provided financial document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

Hayes in 2023, adjusted for the change in annual compensation starting June 1, 2023.\n\n2. **Analyze the document:**\n\n   - According to paragraph [224], Robert M. Hayes's annual compensation was increased to $600,000 effective June 1, 2023, from $400,000.\n   - The Summary Compensation Table shows that for the year 2023, Robert M. Hayes earned a salary of $416,666, a bonus of $100,000, and other payments of $272,307, summing up to a total of $788,973.\n\n3. **Step-by-step verification:**\n\n   - Initially, from January 1, 2023, to May 31, 2023, Hayes was earning $400,000 annually. This period is 5 months.\n   - The prorated salary for this period is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{5}{12} \\times 400,000 = \\frac{5 \\times 400,000}{12} = \\frac{2,000,000}{12} = 166,666.67\n     \\]\n\n   - From June 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023, which is 7 months, Hayes was earning $600,000 annually.\n   - The prorated salary for this period is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{7}{12} \\times 600,000 = \\frac{7 \\times 600,000}{12} = \\frac{4,200,000}{12} = 350,000\n     \\]\n\n   - Summing these prorated salaries, the total salary for Robert M. Hayes in 2023 is:\n     \\[\n     166,666.67 + 350,000 = 516,666.67\n     \\]\n\n   - Adding the bonus and other payments:\n     - Bonus: $100,000\n     - Other payments: $272,307\n     - Total additional compensation: $372,307\n\n   - The adjusted total compensation for 2023 is:\n     \\[\n     516,666.67 + 372,307 = 888,973.67\n     \\]\n\n4. **Compare with the given statement:**\n\n   - The given statement claims the total compensation is $1,038,973.\n   - Our calculated total is $888,973.67.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** based on the provided financial document.\n\nFinal determination: **Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

Calculate the percentage that the impairment charges represent of the total goodwill and intangible assets.\n4. Compare the calculated percentage with the percentage given in the statement (2.09%).\n\n### Step 1: Determine the total impairment charges on goodwill and intangible assets in 2023.\nFrom the document:\n- Paragraph 69 mentions a non-cash intangible asset impairment charge of $43.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n- Paragraph 169 confirms this impairment charge of $43.5 million for an indefinite-lived sales trade name for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n- Paragraph 196 also mentions the $43.5 million non-cash trade name intangible asset impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nTherefore, the total impairment charges for 2023 are $43.5 million.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the total value of goodwill and intangible assets on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2023.\nFrom the document:\n- Paragraph 68 states that goodwill and intangible assets recorded on the balance sheet were $0.9 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2023.\n\nTherefore, the total value of goodwill and intangible assets is $0.9 billion + $1.6 billion = $2.5 billion.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the percentage that the impairment charges represent of the total goodwill and intangible assets.\nTo find the percentage, we use the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Impairment Charges}}{\\text{Total Goodwill and Intangible Assets}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{43.5 \\text{ million}}{2.5 \\text{ billion}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, convert 2.5 billion to millions:\n\\[ 2.5 \\text{ billion} = 2500 \\text{ million} \\]\n\nNow calculate the percentage:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{43.5}{2500} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 1.74\\% \\]\n\n### Step 4: Compare the calculated percentage with the percentage given in the statement (2.09%).\nThe calculated percentage (1.74%) is less than the percentage given in the statement (2.09%).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe statement claims that the impairment charges on goodwill and intangible assets in 2023 represent 2.09% of the total goodwill and intangible assets on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. However, our calculation shows that the impairment charges represent approximately 1.74% of the total goodwill and intangible assets.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

            " To verify the statement, we need to calculate the total amount of option awards granted to Robert M. Hayes as of December 31, 2023, based on the information provided in the financial document. We should look for any relevant data related to option awards granted to Robert M. Hayes in the document.\n\nLet's examine the document step by step:\n\n1. **Notification of option awards in the document:**\n   - Paragraph ID 251 lists the outstanding equity awards as of December 31, 2023, where Robert M. Hayes has various option awards listed.\n\n2. **Calculating the total amount of option awards:**\n   - We need to calculate the total value of the option awards granted to Robert M. Hayes.\n\nHere is the relevant information from Paragraph ID 251:\n```\n| Option Awards |\n| Name              | Number of Securities Underlying Unexercised Options (#) Vested | Number of Securities Underlying Unexercised Options (#) Unvested | Option Exercise Price ($) | Option Expiration Date |\n|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Robert M. Hayes  | 154,125                                                      | 171,875                                                         | 1.37                    | 1/25/2028             |\n| 49,856           | 20,144                                                       | 1.21                                                            | 5/2/2027                |\n| 95,238           | 19,038                                                       | 7.00                                                            | 9/9/2026                |\n```\n\nThe total number of options granted to Robert M. Hayes is the sum of the vested and unvested options for each exercise price:\n- For the options with the exercise price of $1.37: \\(154,125 + 171,875 = 326,000\\) options\n- For the options with the exercise price of $1.21: \\(49,856 + 20,144 = 70,000\\) options\n- For the options with the exercise price of $7.00: \\(95,238 + 19,038 = 114,276\\) options\n\n3. **Adding up the total number of options:**\n\\[\n326,000 + 70,000 + 114,276 = 510,276 \\, \\text{options}\n\\]\n\n4. **Calculating the total value of option awards:**\n   - To calculate the total value, we need to estimate the fair value of these options. The estimated weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the year ended December 31, 2023, was $0.80 per share (from Paragraph ID 201).\n\nLet's calculate the total value of the options:\n\\[\n510,276 \\, \\text{options} \\times \\$0.80 = \\$408,220.80\n\\]\n\nThe document does not specify that any other option awards were granted to Robert M. Hayes, so we can conclude with the computed value.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe total amount of option awards granted to Robert M. Hayes as of December 31, 2023, is $408,220.80.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

            " To assess the statement, we need to focus on the financial impact of the business combination on Estrella's accumulated deficit and verify if the mentioned percentage change is accurate. Here are the steps to analyze this:\n\n1. **Identify relevant financial data from the document**:\n   - As per paragraph id 136, Estrella received net proceeds of approximately $20.1 million from the Business Combination and concurrent financing transactions after various deductions.\n   - Paragraph id 145 indicates that net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $13.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023.\n\n2. **Understanding the impact on the accumulated deficit**:\n   - The financial document does not provide direct information about the accumulated deficit before and after the business combination. It's crucial to understand that the accumulated deficit typically represents the cumulative losses a company has incurred since its inception.\n   - The statement claims that the business combination decreased Estrella's accumulated deficit by approximately 133.11% by December 31, 2023.\n\n3. **Analyzing the statement**:\n   - A decrease in the accumulated deficit by more than 100% implies that the company not only covered its accumulated deficit but also generated a surplus.\n   - To decrease the accumulated deficit by 133.11%, Estrella would need to have an inflow of funds that not only covers its existing deficit but also adds extra funds equal to more than the original deficit.\n\n4. **Cross-referencing financial activities**:\n   - According to paragraphs 136 and 145, Estrella received significant inflows of about $20.1 million from the Business Combination and $13.1 million from financing activities. These inflows suggest that a substantial portion of the funds went towards covering existing capital needs and possibly reducing deficits.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Without the specific values of Estrella's accumulated deficit before and after the business combination, we cannot directly verify the exact percentage decrease.\n   - However, the large inflows of cash from the Business Combination and financing activities support the notion that Estrella could have significantly reduced or even converted its deficit into a surplus.\n\nGiven the information available, it is plausible that the business combination and the related financing activities had a substantial positive impact on Estrella's financial position. However, without specific deficit numbers, we cannot verify the exact percentage decrease.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed**."

            " To verify the statement, we need to check two conditions:\n\n1. The net tangible assets must be more than $5 million immediately before the consummation of the initial business combination.\n2. Public stockholders may receive approximately $11.01 per share if the combination is unsuccessful and liquidation occurs after April 1, 2024.\n\nLet's analyze the provided financial document to verify these conditions:\n\n### Condition 1: Net Tangible Assets\nAccording to the document (paragraph id = 20), the company may redeem public shares under certain conditions:\n- \"in no event will we redeem our public shares unless our net tangible assets are at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters' fees and commissions.\"\n\nThis statement indicates that the company's net tangible assets must be at least $5,000,001 immediately prior to or at the consummation of the initial business combination.\n\n### Condition 2: Redemption Amount per Share\nThe provided document gives specific details about the redemption amount:\n- \"In certain circumstances, our public stockholders may receive less than approximately $11.01 per share on the redemption of their shares.\" (paragraph id = 17)\n\nMoreover, on December 31, 2023, the approximate redemption amount mentioned is $11.01 per share. There are also mentions of redemption amounts on other dates such as $10.10 per share and $10.83 per share.\n\nHowever, for the redemption amount to be approximately $11.01 per share, it would depend on the value at the time and potentially additional claims or reductions that could affect that amount.\n\n### Conclusion:\n1. **Net Tangible Assets Requirement:** The document confirms that the company\u2019s net tangible assets must be at least $5,000,001 before the business combination. This part of the statement is supported by the document.\n2. **Redemption Amount per Share:** The document indicates that $11.01 per share is mentionable under certain circumstances, but it also provides other redemption scenarios (like $10.10 per share and $10.83 per share), which suggests that there is some variability based on factors like the time of redemption and additional claims or reductions.\n\nGiven this variability, and considering the numerous circumstances mentioned, it is difficult to conclusively state that public stockholders will receive approximately $11.01 per share upon liquidation after April 1, 2024.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

However, the document does not provide this information.\n\n4. **Estimate the Savings:**\n   - Without the explicit SOFR, we cannot accurately calculate the interest savings. However, we can investigate if any implicit information suggests the savings amount.\n   - The document states: \"Based on the Corporation\u2019s variable-rate debt balance outstanding at December 30, 2023, a hypothetical 100 basis point change in the applicable interest rates would not have a material impact on the interest expense incurred by the Corporation.\" This suggests that interest rate fluctuations within 100 basis points would not materially affect the interest expense.\n\n5. **Check for Any Direct Mention of Savings:**\n   - There is no direct mention in the document of $2.3 million in annual interest savings due to the interest rate swap.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis above, the financial document does not provide sufficient data to confirm the annual savings of $2.3 million from the interest rate swap agreement.

            " ### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - From paragraph [78], we know that each holder of Estrella's Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to receive dividends \"at the rate of 8% of the original issue price of $1.00 per share.\"\n   - Paragraphs [76] and [77] indicate that multiple issues of Series A Preferred Stock occurred. However, the primary consideration for dividend yields would be the latest transaction details provided.\n   - Paragraph [77] states that immediately prior to the effective time of the merger with UPTD, investors purchased an aggregate of 9,250,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for $9,250,000. Additionally, 750,000 more shares were issued to White Lion.\n   - It is crucial to understand that the initial purchases and dividend entitlements were based on a consistent investment amount for Series A Preferred Stock ($1.00 per share).\n\n2. **Calculate Dividend Yield:**\n   - The dividend rate is 8% of the original issue price. The original issue price is $1.00 per share.\n   - Therefore, the dividend per share is: \\( 0.08 \\times 1 = 0.08 \\) dollars per share.\n   - If an investor held these shares throughout 2023, the dividend yield would be:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Dividend Yield} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Dividend Amount}}{\\text{Original Issue Price}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{0.08}{1} \\right) \\times 100 = 8\\%\n     \\]\n\n3. **Investment Value in July 2023:**\n   - Paragraph [77] mentions that in July 2023, 9,250,000 shares were purchased for $9,250,000. The investment value per share remains consistent at $1.00.\n   - Therefore, if the statement refers to the investment made in July 2023, the effective dividend yield for held Series A Preferred Stock is indeed 8%, matching the declared dividend rate.\n\n4. **Final Determination:**\n   - The statement claims that the effective dividend yield for Estrella Series A Preferred Stock, assuming it was held throughout 2023, is 8% of the investment made in July 2023.\n   - Given the above calculations and consistent investment value of $1.00 per share, this matches the information provided in the financial document.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the information given in the financial document, the statement is supported by the provided data.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

Let's break down the statement into its key components and analyze each part step-by-step:\n\n### Key Components of the Statement:\n1. The company is operating at a net loss.\n2. The company heavily relies on equity financing.\n3. Management prepared financial statements on a going concern basis.\n4. Management leveraged a substantial decrease in operating expenses.\n5. This was done to optimize the capital structure.\n6. This optimization aims to support future expansion plans in global markets.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### 1. The company is operating at a net loss.\n- **Evidence**: From paragraph ID: 1, we observe that the company has an \"Accumulated deficit\" of $(171,878) as of November 30, 2023, and $(155,883) as of February 28, 2023. This indicates that the company is indeed operating at a net loss.\n\n  **Conclusion**: This part of the statement is entailed by the document.\n\n#### 2. The company heavily relies on equity financing.\n- **Evidence**: In paragraph ID: 11, it is mentioned that \"The Company has incurred net losses and negative cash flow from operating and investing activities since its inception and expects to incur additional net losses while it continues to develop and plan for commercialization. ... Its ongoing operations and commercialization plans have been financed primarily by raising equity.\"\n\n  **Conclusion**: This part of the statement is entailed by the document.\n\n#### 3. Management prepared financial statements on a going concern basis.\n- **Evidence**: Paragraph ID: 11 states, \"The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the continuing of operations, the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business.\"\n\n  **Conclusion**: This part of the statement is entailed by the document.\n\n#### 4. Management leveraged a substantial decrease in operating expenses.\n- **Evidence**: The document does not explicitly mention a \"substantial decrease in operating expenses.\" Instead, it discusses the ongoing financial challenges and the reliance on equity financing. There is no specific data provided to support or refute this claim directly.\n\n  **Conclusion**: This part of the statement cannot be verified as entailed or refuted based on the provided document.\n\n#### 5. This was done to optimize the capital structure.\n- **Evidence**: The document discusses management's active monitoring of the company's liquidity and cash resources. However, there is no explicit mention of optimizing the capital structure through decreased operating expenses.\n\n  **Conclusion**: This part of the statement cannot be verified as entailed or refuted based on the provided document.\n\n#### 6. This optimization aims to support future expansion plans in global markets.\n- **Evidence**: Paragraph ID: 132 mentions, \"Management continues to pursue our growth strategy and is evaluating our financing plans to continue to raise capital to finance the start-up of commercial operations and continue to fund our ongoing operations. We will require a significant amount of capital to fund our growth as we invest in our planned commercial facilities in Europe, Asia and North America, as well as additional research and development.\"\n\n  **Conclusion**: This part of the statement is entailed by the document.\n\n### Final Determination:\nBased on the provided financial document, certain components of the statement are supported, specifically concerning the net loss, reliance on equity financing, financial statements prepared on a going concern basis, and future expansion plans. However, the statement regarding a \"substantial decrease in operating expenses\" to optimize the capital structure cannot be verified from the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** due to the lack of evidence supporting the substantial decrease in operating expenses and its link to optimizing the capital structure."

We need to confirm if this increase happened during Fiscal 2024.\n2. **25% rise in stock repurchase authorization**: The statement mentions a 25% rise in stock repurchase authorization. We need to verify if this increase occurred during Fiscal 2024.\n3. **Diverse and robust revenue performance in Fiscal 2024**: The statement suggests strong revenue performance during Fiscal 2024. We need to check if the document supports this notion.\n\nLet's analyze the document step by step:\n\n1. **20% increase in quarterly dividends**:\n   - According to paragraph id = 34, in September 2023, the board of directors increased the regular quarterly cash dividend by 20% from $0.25 to $0.30 per share of common stock for the cash dividend paid in October 2023. This confirms the 20% increase in quarterly dividends.\n\n2. **25% rise in stock repurchase authorization**:\n   - According to paragraph id = 35, during Fiscal 2023, the board of directors authorized an increase in the share repurchase program from $100 million to $125 million. This represents a 25% increase in the stock repurchase authorization.\n\n3. **Diverse and robust revenue performance in Fiscal 2024**:\n   - The document does not provide detailed numerical data on the revenue performance for Fiscal 2024. However, it mentions that the power industry services segment provided 73% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2024, and the industrial construction services segment represented 25% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2024 (paragraph id = 110). This suggests a relatively balanced revenue distribution across segments, indicating a level of diversity in revenue streams.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that the statement aligns with the information provided in the financial document regarding the increase in dividends and stock repurchase authorization. However, the document does not explicitly provide data to support the notion of \"robust\" revenue performance in Fiscal 2024, although it indicates a balanced revenue distribution across segments.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe statement about the 20% increase in quarterly dividends and the 25% rise in stock repurchase authorization is supported by the document. The statement about diverse and robust revenue performance in Fiscal 2024 is supported to the extent that the document indicates diversity in revenue streams, but it does not provide specific data to support the notion of \"robust\" performance.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

Paragraph 84 outlines an impairment charge of $282.2 million recognized during an interim goodwill impairment test due to a decline in market capitalization, and a $65.6 million impairment of long-term assets noted at year-end 2023.\n2. Paragraph 87 explains that the company's revenue is heavily concentrated, with two customers comprising 85.1% of total revenue.\n3. Asset concentration risk suggests that reliance on a few major customers can heighten vulnerability to revenue fluctuations, impacting the company's financial stability, which aligns with the impairment risks noted in paragraph 84.\n4. Goodwill Impairment Testing requires a reassessment of asset value when market conditions affect expected future cash flows\u2014this principle helps elucidate the impact of reduced reliability of revenue streams and concentrated customer dependency on asset valuation. \n5.

However, it does not explicitly link these impairments to a concentrated customer base or market volatility. Despite this, the broader context aligns with the statement's concerns.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

The potential impact of Class A shares redemption on minority shareholder rights.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the voting power of Canna-Global LLC**\n\nFrom paragraph id = 190, we can see the breakdown of share ownership:\n- Canna-Global LLC owns 5,629,000 Class B shares, representing 97.9% of the class and 83.9% of the total outstanding common stock.\n- Other executives and directors collectively own 76,000 Class B shares.\n\nThis confirms that Canna-Global LLC has significant voting power with its Class B shares, as stated in the given statement.\n\n**Step 2: Impact of Class A shares redemption**\n\nFrom paragraph id = 238, we know that:\n- Stockholders had the right to redeem their shares for cash.\n- Holders of 20,630,630 shares of Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem those shares for cash at an approximate price of $10.26 per share.\n\nRedemption of Class A shares reduces the number of outstanding shares, potentially increasing the proportional voting power of remaining shares. However, since Canna-Global LLC holds Class B shares, which have higher voting rights, the redemption of Class A shares may not significantly impact its voting power. Instead, redemption could lead to a decrease in the number of minority shareholders, potentially affecting their collective influence.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe given statement is accurate as Canna-Global LLC's significant voting power (83.9%) through its Class B shares could potentially undermine minority shareholder rights, depending on the redemption rate of Class A shares.

(Paragraph 72)\n   - The table in paragraph 219 specifies that these 70 shares were purchased in January 2024.\n\n2. **Authorization for Share Repurchase:**\n   - The statement mentions an authorization to repurchase up to 2,500 shares. However, the document mentions that the maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the publicly announced plans or programs is 2,217 shares (as of January 31, 2024, after purchasing 70 shares).\n\n3. **Potential Impact on Earnings per Share:**\n   - The statement suggests that the share repurchase program aims to potentially enhance earnings per share (EPS) by reducing the outstanding share count. This is a common financial strategy, but the document does not explicitly state this intent.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The document confirms the purchase of 70 shares in January 2024.\n- The document confirms an ongoing authorization to repurchase shares, with a remaining authorization of 2,217 shares.\n- The statement about enhancing EPS through reducing the share count is a typical financial strategy but not explicitly mentioned in the document.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the document confirms the purchase of 70 shares and the ongoing authorization to repurchase shares, the statement aligns with the information provided in the document. However, the explicit intent to enhance EPS is not mentioned, but it is a common financial strategy tied to share repurchases.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

            " ### Step 1: Identify the Context and Key Information\nThe statement references a goodwill impairment of $820 million recognized for Tripadvisor in 2023. We need to identify the context of this impairment in the financial document and assess its relation to underlying issues in consumer engagement and competitive positioning.\n\n### Step 2: Locate the Relevant Information in the Document\nIn the paragraph [id = 7], it is mentioned:\n\n- **\"Tripadvisor believes that consumers will continue to seek connection with others, discover new places, and experience new things through travel.\"**\n- **\"During 2023, Tripadvisor continued to experience strong consumer demand for its offerings, particularly for its experiences offerings across the Viator and Brand Tripadvisor segments.\"**\n\nIt can be inferred that Tripadvisor has been focused on improving user experience and engaging consumers.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Goodwill Impairment\nIn paragraph [id = 18] and [id = 19], the impairment is discussed:\n\n- **\"The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant negative impact on the travel and hospitality industries and consequently, adversely and materially affected Tripadvisor\u2019s business, results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition through the first quarter of 2022.\"**\n- **\"Given a sustained decline in Tripadvisor\u2019s stock price leading up to September 30, 2023, TripCo performed a quantitative analysis of the Brand Tripadvisor (formerly Tripadvisor Core) reporting unit and Tripadvisor trademark as of September 30, 2023. Based on near-term business trends and their impact on long-term assumptions, combined with macro-economic factors such as rising interest rates, TripCo concluded that the estimated fair values of the Brand Tripadvisor reporting unit and the Tripadvisor trademark were less than their respective carrying values.\"**\n- **\"As a result, TripCo recognized a goodwill impairment of $820 million and a trademark impairment of $205 million during the third quarter of 2023, related to the Brand Tripadvisor reporting unit. Declines in the future revenue outlook, cash flows, or other changes in the business, may necessitate future impairments, which could be material.\"**\n\n### Step 4: Assess Underlying Issues\nThe impairment suggests that Tripadvisor's financial performance and future cash flows were not meeting expectations. This could imply underlying issues in consumer engagement and competitive positioning despite their efforts to improve the user experience.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate Tripadvisor's Strategic Focus\nParagraph [id = 47] outlines Tripadvisor's strategies and challenges:\n\n- **\"Tripadvisor\u2019s dedication to making the consumer experience its highest priority may cause it to prioritize rapid innovation and consumer experience over short-term financial results. Tripadvisor strives to create the best experience for its consumers. Tripadvisor believes that in doing so it will increase its traffic conversion (i.e., visitors converting into clicks and/or bookings), revenue and financial performance.\"**\n- **\"Tripadvisor has taken actions in the past, and may continue to take actions in the future, that have the effect of reducing its short-term financial results if it believes the actions benefit the overall consumer experience.\"**\n\n### Conclusion\nThe $820 million goodwill impairment recognized for Tripadvisor in 2023 indicates underlying issues in consumer engagement and competitive positioning, despite efforts focused on improving user experience and rapid innovation over short-term financial results. The reduction in the fair values of their reporting unit and trademark suggests that the efforts to innovate and focus on the consumer experience have not translated into the expected financial outcomes. Therefore, the statement is entailed by the document.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

However, we can infer from the overall financial reports whether significant fluctuations are evident.\n   - Revenue and expense figures for both periods (three months and six months ended January 31, 2024) show stable trends without significant fluctuations that might indicate adverse foreign currency impacts.\n\nHowever, the document lacks explicit details on currency-denominated revenues and expenses or specific strategies used to balance foreign currency exposure. Therefore, we cannot conclusively verify this part based on the provided financial document.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe first part of the statement regarding 8% of its assets in potentially volatile debt and equity securities is supported by the financial data provided. However, the second part regarding mitigating investment risk through balancing foreign currency exposure cannot be conclusively verified due to the lack of explicit information on foreign currency management strategies in the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is entailed partially based on the provided document, but the lack of explicit confirmation of foreign currency management strategies makes the complete verification of the statement inconclusive.\n\nThus, the statement is **entailed** based on the verified aspects, but additional information is needed for a comprehensive assessment."

Such reimbursement is performed at cost with the affiliate realizing no profit on the transaction.\"\n   - This indicates that FutureFuel Corp. reimburses its affiliates for services at cost, with no profit added.\n\n2. **Segment Reporting (Paragraph ID = 337):**\n   - The document discusses two reportable segments: chemicals and biofuels.\n   - It also mentions that \"Expenses related to these services comprise an agreed quarterly fee plus reimbursement of expense, at cost and are reported as selling, general, and administrative expenses.\"\n\n3. **Accounting Policies and Revenue Recognition (Paragraph IDs = 251, 276):**\n   - The document outlines that the company recognizes revenue based on the principles in ASC Topic 606 and short-term contracts.\n   - It also notes that \"The Company sells its products directly to customers generally under agreements with payment terms of 30 to 75 days for chemical segment customers and 2 to 10 days for biofuels segment customers.\"\n\n### Analysis of the Statement\n\n- **Transfer Pricing at Arm's Length:**\n  - The document states that reimbursement to affiliates is \"at cost,\" which aligns with arm\u2019s length principles ensuring no profit margin is added for the affiliate. This is a common practice to avoid tax penalties related to transfer pricing.\n\n- **Segment Reporting:**\n  - The document mentions that expenses related to these services are reported under SG&A (selling, general, and administrative expenses). This implies that these costs are consolidated and affect the profitability of both the chemical and biofuel segments since SG&A is a common expense category for both segments.\n\n- **Strategic Application:**\n  - The statement also suggests a strategic application which may involve ensuring compliance with tax regulations and maintaining effective segment reporting. The document supports this by detailing the compliance with ASC Topic 606 and the consolidation of costs under SG&A.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the provided financial document, the statement is aligned with the information presented. The reimbursement to affiliates at cost reflects adherence to arm\u2019s length principles, and the reporting of these costs under SG&A impacts the profitability of both segments.

            " To verify the statement, we need to analyze the relevant sections of the financial document that discuss the compensation strategy, philosophy, and specific details about time-vested equity awards.\n\n1. **Compensation Philosophy**:\n   - Paragraph id 80 states: \"Alignment with Stockholder Interests. Our compensation is intended to closely align the interests of our NEOs with those of our stockholders in an effort to create long-term stockholder value.\"\n   - This aligns with the part of the statement regarding \"aligning executive interests with stockholder returns.\"\n\n2. **Long-Term Incentive Awards**:\n   - The document discusses long-term incentive awards in paragraph id 79: \"Long-term incentive awards are intended to recognize and reward the achievement of long-term corporate goals and objectives, recognize promotions, motivate retention of our leadership talent and align executives\u2019 interests with our stockholders.\"\n   - This section highlights the long-term focus and intent to align with stockholders' interests, which matches the statement's principle of long-term retention goals.\n\n3. **Time-Vested Equity Awards**:\n   - Paragraph id 79 further details the time-vested equity awards: \"The Compensation Committee provides time-vested long-term incentives (i) to build a consistent ownership stake and retention incentive, (ii) to create a meaningful tie to the Company\u2019s relative long-term stockholder returns and (iii) to motivate consistent improvement over a longer-term horizon.\"\n   - In 2023, the long-term incentive awards included time-vested equity awards that \"vest over a four-year period.\"\n\n4. **Specific Vesting Schedule**:\n   - In the table provided, it is shown that the latest grant of 5,250 stock options vests over a four-year period, with one-fourth vesting on the first anniversary and the remaining shares vesting monthly over the next three years.\n   - This multiply-year vesting schedule directly supports the statement's mention of \"vesting schedules over multiple years.\"\n\n**Conclusion**:\nGiven the details provided in the financial document, it is clear that the compensation strategy of granting time-vested equity awards aligns with the broader executive compensation philosophy aimed at aligning executive interests with stockholder returns while also addressing the company's long-term retention goals through vesting schedules over multiple years.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

Let's proceed step by step:\n\n1. **Vehicle Debt Proceeds**:\n   - The statement mentions a decrease in vehicle debt proceeds. We need to find evidence related to this in the document.\n   - From paragraph id = 163, we see that \"proceeds from vehicle debt decreased as a result of less issuances in the first quarter of 2024 versus the comparable period in 2023.\" This aligns with the statement.\n\n2. **Non-Vehicle Debt Drawdowns**:\n   - The statement also mentions increased non-vehicle debt drawdowns. We need to confirm this from the document.\n   - Paragraph id = 163 states, \"Cash flows from financing activities were also impacted by a $450 million increase in net proceeds from non-vehicle debt resulting primarily from outstanding draws on the First Lien RCF in the first quarter of 2024.\" This supports the statement.\n\n3. **First Lien Ratio Requirements**:\n   - The statement mentions strategically managing the First Lien Ratio requirements.\n   - From paragraph id = 34, \"In April 2024, the First Lien RCF was amended to require a ratio of less than or equal to 5.0 x in the second and third quarters of 2024 and 4.75 x in the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025.\"\n   - Additionally, paragraph id = 44 states that Hertz was in compliance with the First Lien Ratio as of March 31, 2024, and Amendment No. 8 temporarily increases the First Lien Ratio. This supports strategic management of the First Lien Ratio.\n\n4. **Minimum Liquidity Covenants**:\n   - The statement mentions aligning with its minimum liquidity covenants.

The value of the assets held by George Risk Industries, Inc. as of January 31, 2024.\n2. The presence of internal control weaknesses and the impact of unrealized losses driven by interest rate increases on municipal bonds.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### Step 1: Verify the Asset Value\n\nThe financial document provides a condensed balance sheet for George Risk Industries, Inc. as of January 31, 2024. We need to verify the value of assets mentioned:\n\n- **Total Assets as of January 31, 2024:** $59,073,000\n\nLet's break down the relevant asset category mentioned in the statement:\n\n- **Investments and securities:** $33,593,000\n\nThe total assets are indeed over $55 million, and one specific category, \"Investments and securities,\" is valued at $33.6 million. This aligns with the statement's mention of assets valued at $33.6 million.\n\n#### Step 2: Verify Internal Control Weaknesses and Unrealized Losses\n\nTo verify internal control weaknesses and unrealized losses, we need to check two sections:\n\n1. **Internal Control Weaknesses:**\n   - The \"Controls and Procedures\" section states:\n     ```\n     Based on that evaluation, management concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures employed at the Company were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.\n     ```\n     This indicates that there are internal control weaknesses.\n\n2. **Unrealized Losses Driven by Interest Rate Increases on Municipal Bonds:**\n   - The document does not explicitly mention \"unrealized losses driven by interest rate increases on municipal bonds held as Level 2 inputs.\" However, it does mention \"unrealized gain on equity securities\" in the income statement.\n\nTo accurately determine the truthfulness of the statement regarding unrealized losses, we need to infer from the provided information:\n\n- The relevant line items in the Income Statement for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2024, show \"Unrealized Gain on equity securities\" but do not specify any unrealized losses related to municipal bonds.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The document supports the value of investments and securities as $33.6 million.\n- The document indicates internal control weaknesses.\n- However, there is no explicit mention or evidence of unrealized losses driven by interest rate increases on municipal bonds held as Level 2 inputs.\n\nTherefore, the statement is partially accurate regarding the asset value and internal control weaknesses but lacks sufficient evidence to support the claim about unrealized losses driven by interest rate increases on municipal bonds.\n\n**Final Determination:** Therefore, the statement is **refuted**."

However, it does imply that high levels of debt could limit Kronos' ability to obtain additional financing.\n\nBased on the provided information, the statement is mostly accurate, but it overreaches by stating that Kronos may need to refinance its debt.

Based upon that discovery, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a level that provides reasonable assurance as of the last day of the period covered by this report.\"\n\nThis paragraph clearly states that there was a material weakness in the company's controls over accounting from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 through the second quarter of fiscal year 2024.\n\n**Paragraph id = 53:**\n\"The material weakness in internal control over financial reporting resulted from the lack of controls which allowed for the Company to erroneously maintain a deferred tax liability, which it will not be required to recapture as management does not intend to redeem stock, make distributions or take other actions that would result in the recapture of this reserve. The Company erroneously applied the Section 585 reserve method, whereby it was allowed to, in 1996, change to the specific charge-off method (with no reserve) and recapture the thrift reserves in their entirety if it switched from a thrift charter to a commercial charter prior to 1996. This material weakness resulted in the correction of the material errors and restatement of prior financial statements as disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated audited financial statements contained in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 20, 2023.\"\n\nThis paragraph provides details about the material weakness, specifically mentioning the improper application of Section 585 tax reserve methods.\n\n### Step 3: Draw Conclusions Based on Analysis\nBased on the information from paragraphs 52 and 53, the financial document confirms the following:\n- There was a material weakness in Marathon Bancorp, Inc.'s controls over accounting from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 through the second quarter of fiscal year 2024.\n- This material weakness was related to the improper application of Section 585 tax reserve methods.\n- The company had to correct material errors and restate prior financial statements due to this material weakness, challenging its compliance with financial reporting standards.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe statement is supported by the provided financial document.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

However, the document does not specify that these milestones are aligned with drawdowns on the JVR credit line.\n- **Integration of Executive Rewards with Operational Financing:** While the document mentions the JVR credit line and the CEO's RSU vesting schedule, there is no explicit linkage between the two. The vesting schedule for the RSUs is clearly defined in terms of time and performance milestones, but there is no information suggesting these milestones are directly related to the specifics of the JVR credit drawdowns.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe given statement implies a direct integration and alignment between the CEO's RSU vesting schedule and drawdowns on the JVR credit line. However, the document does not explicitly support such integration or alignment.

The valuation method and process for private placement and PIPE warrants in 2023.\n\nLet's analyze the document step by step:\n\n1. **Exclusion of share-based equity awards from dilutive EPS calculation:**\n\n   In paragraph id = 370, there is a table showing the schedule of share-based equity awards excluded from the computation of dilutive loss:\n\n   | For year Ended December 31 | 2023 | 2022 |\n   |---------------------------|------|------|\n   | Warrants                 | 12,786,588 | 7,036,588 |\n   | Share based payments      | 2,643,277 | 2,170,000 |\n   | Shares to be issued to Abaca shareholders | - | 6,433,839 |\n   | Conversion of preferred stock | 880,800 | 13,443,000 |\n   | Grand total              | 16,310,665 | 29,083,427 |\n\n   The grand total for the year ended December 31, 2023, is indeed over 16.3 million (16,310,665). This confirms the first part of the statement.\n\n2. **Valuation method and process for private placement and PIPE warrants in 2023:**\n\n   Paragraph id = 385 states:\n   \"PIPE Warrants: PIPE Warrants are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. In 2023, the Company internally assessed the value of these derivatives with Level 3 inputs, which are derived from Black-Scholes model.\"\n\n   Paragraph id = 397 also confirms this information:\n   \"In 2023, the valuation of private placement warrants, PIPE warrants, and Abaca warrants was carried out using the Black-Scholes model...\"\n\n   These paragraphs confirm that the company used the Black-Scholes model for the valuation of private placement and PIPE warrants in 2023 and that the process involved a comprehensive internal assessment using Level 3 inputs.\n\nSince both parts of the statement are supported by the document, we can conclude:\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

Let's break down the statement and compare it with the provided document:\n\n### Statement Analysis\nThe statement posits two main challenges:\n1. **Increasing data protection regulations** (such as the CCPA).\n2. **Potential legislative changes in franchise liability**.\n\nBoth challenges are said to potentially strain the company's resources and require substantial cost allocations for compliance and risk management.\n\n### Document Analysis\nWe need to look for paragraphs in the document that discuss data protection, compliance, risk management, and potential legislative changes. Let's analyze the relevant sections:\n\n**Paragraph 89**:\n- \"Business incidents, whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us or our business partners, that erode consumer trust can significantly reduce brand value, potentially trigger boycotts of our locations or result in civil or criminal liability and can have a negative impact on our financial results.\"\n- \"The impact of such incidents may be exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity, including rapidly through social or digital media...\"\n\nThis paragraph discusses the potential impacts of negative incidents on the company's brand and financial results, including incidents related to data protection such as \"actual or perceived breaches of privacy.\"\n\nHowever, there is no explicit mention of specific regulations like the CCPA or potential legislative changes in franchise liability.\n\n**Paragraph 90**:\n- \"Our success depends in large part upon our ability to maintain our corporate reputation. For example, the reputation of our Reborn brand could be damaged by claims or perceptions about the quality or safety of our ingredients or beverages or the quality or reputation of our suppliers, distributors or future franchise partners...\"\n- \"Our corporate reputation could also suffer from negative publicity or consumer sentiment regarding Reborn action or inaction or brand imagery, a real or perceived failure of corporate governance, or misconduct by any officer or any employee or representative of us or a future franchise partner.\"\n\nThis paragraph discusses the risks related to maintaining the company's reputation, which includes handling incidents that could harm the brand, but again, there is no mention of specific regulations or legislative changes.\n\n### Reasoning\n- The document mentions general risks related to privacy breaches and consumer trust, which can be broadly associated with compliance and risk management related to data protection regulations.\n- However, the document does not specifically discuss the CCPA or potential legislative changes in franchise liability.\n- The document focuses more on the impact of negative incidents on the company's brand and financial results rather than the specific costs associated with compliance and risk management due to increasing data protection regulations and legislative changes.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven that the document does not explicitly discuss the increasing data protection regulations (such as the CCPA) or potential legislative changes in franchise liability, and does not mention the substantial cost allocations required for compliance and risk management in this context, the statement cannot be supported by the provided document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

            " To verify the given statement, we need to assess the following points based on the provided financial document:\n\n1. **Increase in Term Loan borrowings:**\n   - The document mentions that as of March 31, 2024, the Company reported an aggregate of $1,620.9 million in borrowings under the Term Loan, compared to $1,500.0 million on December 31, 2023. This confirms an increase in Term Loan borrowings.\n\n2. **Significant raise in cash reserves:**\n   - The document does not explicitly state that the increase in Term Loan borrowings was used to significantly raise cash reserves. However, it mentions that the Company incurred financing costs in connection with the expansion of the Term Loan, which suggests that the additional borrowings were utilized for some purpose which could potentially include increasing cash reserves.\n\n3. **Future challenges in maintaining a favorable debt servicing ratio:**\n   - The document does not provide direct information about the Company's debt servicing ratio or any challenges in maintaining it. However, it does mention that the interest rate on the Term Loan is variable and tied to SOFR, which has a floor of 0.75%. Additionally, the Company has an interest rate cap contract that provides protection up to a certain level of SOFR.\n\n4. **Enhanced interest burden and rising SOFR rates:**\n   - The document states that the interest rate on the Term Loan is SOFR plus 2.5%, with a 0.75% SOFR floor. It also mentions that for every 25 basis points increase in SOFR above the level of the cap, the Company expects its annual interest expense to increase by an additional $1.6 million related to the unhedged portion of the Term Loan. This confirms that rising SOFR rates could enhance the interest burden.\n\nBased on the given document, while it is true that the Company's Term Loan borrowings have increased and that rising SOFR rates could lead to a higher interest burden, the document does not provide sufficient information to conclude that this will lead to future challenges in maintaining a favorable debt servicing ratio. The document does not provide enough data to assess the Company's ability to service its debt, as it does not discuss the Company's income, cash flows, or other debts.\n\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, the statement is **refuted** based on the provided financial document, as it does not provide enough information to support the claim about future challenges in maintaining a favorable debt servicing ratio."

This is due to potential interest rate risks that might not be fully offset by the high duration of fixed income investments.\n\n2. **Relevant Financial Data**:\n   - **Asset Allocation**: According to paragraph id = 302, the Plan's target allocation is approximately 86% fixed income and 14% equity.\n   - **Weighted Average Discount Rate**: From paragraph id = 207 and 300, we see that the weighted average discount rate for 2023 is indeed 5.25%.\n   - **Net Periodic Pension Cost**: From paragraph id = 299, the net periodic pension cost for 2023 is $733 thousand.\n\n3. **Reasoning**:\n   - The Plan's high concentration in fixed income investments is intended to mitigate risk, as mentioned in the statement and confirmed in paragraph id = 302.\n   - The weighted average discount rate did increase to 5.25% in 2023, as seen in paragraph id = 207 and 300.\n   - However, the statement suggests that this increase might lead to volatility in the net periodic pension cost due to interest rate risks. To verify this, we need to check if there's any indication of such volatility.\n   - Looking at paragraph id = 299, we see that the net periodic pension cost has indeed fluctuated over the past three years: $(2,564) thousand in 2022, $(1,839) thousand in 2021, and $733 thousand in 2023. This shows volatility in the net periodic pension cost.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   The statement is supported by the data provided in the document. The Plan's weighted average discount rate increased to 5.25% in 2023, and there's been volatility in the net periodic pension cost. While the document doesn't directly attribute this volatility to interest rate risks or the duration of fixed income investments, it also doesn't contradict this possibility. Therefore, the statement is entailed.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

Here is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant section discussing interest rate swaps**:\n   - From the financial document, paragraph [paragraph id = 23] mentions that the company entered into an interest rate swap in fiscal 2020 to hedge exposure to variability in cash flows from interest payments on their floating-rate revolving credit facility.\n\n2. **Determine the impact of interest rate swaps on interest expense**:\n   - The document states that the interest rate swap contract had a notional value of $30.0 million as of November 25, 2023, with a maturity date of February 5, 2026. However, there is no explicit mention of the impact of this swap on reducing interest expense by a specific percentage.\n\n3. **Analyze the interest expense data**:\n   - According to paragraph [paragraph id = 44], \"Interest payments under the U.S. and Canadian credit facilities were $7.5 million ... for the nine months ended November 25, 2023 and November 26, 2022, respectively.\"\n   - Paragraph [paragraph id = 71] states, \"Interest expense, net was $1.5 million, compared to $2.6 million.\"\n   - Paragraph [paragraph id = 75] states, \"Interest expense, net was $5.7 million, compared to $5.5 million.\"\n\n4. **Assess the percentage change in interest expense**:\n   - The interest expense for the nine months ended November 25, 2023 (fiscal 2024) is $5.7 million, compared to $5.5 million for the same period in fiscal 2023.\n   - This represents a slight increase in interest expense, not a reduction.\n\n5. **Evaluate the statement**:\n   - The provided financial document does not support the claim that the company reduced its interest expense by 43.9% in 2023 through the use of interest rate swaps.

They partner with large insurance companies to hold HSA cash through group annuity contracts, which typically provide higher yields compared to deposits held by Depository Partners. (paragraph id = 36)\n- **Risk Mitigation**: Increased participation in the Enhanced Rates offering reduces the company's exposure to short-term fluctuations in prevailing interest rates because the contract repricing occurs gradually, at approximately 10% per year.

(\u201cBDVB\u201d), initially representing 41.2% ownership... During 2023, BDVB, issued an additional one million shares reducing our ownership to approximately 39.6%.\"\n- **Paragraph id = 139**: \"Our 2022 acquisitions have allowed us to diversify our operations into new restaurant segments and new geographic regions, reducing our dependency on the financial performance of our Burger Time restaurants.\"\n\nThese paragraphs suggest that the investment in Bagger Dave's is part of a larger strategy to diversify operations and reduce dependency on a single segment. There is no explicit mention of significant regulatory hurdles impacting this investment.\n\nAdditionally, **Paragraph id = 180** states:\n- \"Following the investment, representatives of BT Brands were appointed to two of the three positions on Bagger Dave\u2019s board of directors.\"\n- \"BDVB files quarterly and annual financial reports with OTCMarkets, Inc. The listing with OTC Markets does not require the information to be audited.\"\n\nThis indicates strategic control and oversight through board representation, but it does not suggest significant regulatory hurdles impacting these investments.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the provided financial document:\n1. The equity method accounting investment in Bagger Dave's is correctly valued at $729,325.\n2. The investment appears to be part of a strategic effort to diversify operations without mention of significant regulatory hurdles.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

On January 24, 2023, the Company resumed quarterly distributions to holders of its preferred stock. No dividends may be paid on our common stock until such time as the preferred stock distributions are made current.\"\n\n3. **Analyzing the Provided Statement**:\n    - The statement to verify is: \"Despite Sotherly Hotels Inc.'s resumption of preferred stock distributions in 2023, no common stock dividends could be paid due to outstanding arrears in preferred dividends, highlighting compliance complexities with REIT distribution requirements under the Securities Exchange Act exemptions utilized for unit redemptions.\"\n\n4. **Direct References**:\n    - **Paragraph 177** explicitly states: \"No dividends may be paid on our common stock until such time as the preferred stock distributions are made current.\" This aligns with the context that the resumption of preferred stock distributions in 2023 does not automatically mean common stock dividends can be paid, as arrears need to be addressed first.\n\n5. **Documentation and Quotes**:\n    - From **Paragraph 59**: \"Once the payment of all preferred dividends in arrears has been made, the Company may make the common stock dividend distribution that was declared in January 2020.\"\n    - From **Paragraph 177**: \"No dividends may be paid on our common stock until such time as the preferred stock distributions are made current.\"\n\n6. **Consistency and Confirmation**:\n    - These quoted sections consistently confirm the conditionality of common stock dividends on making preferred distributions current first, supporting the statement provided.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The provided financial document supports the statement that despite the resumption of preferred stock distributions in 2023, no common stock dividends can be paid due to outstanding arrears in preferred dividends. This is consistent with the REIT distribution requirements.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

            " To assess whether the given statement is entailed or refuted by the document, we need to analyze the context related to the lock-up agreements mentioned. Here are the steps to systematically check the provided financial document:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Paragraphs:**\n   - The statement mentions lock-up agreements and potential market pressure on PubCo's share value and liquidity. The relevant paragraphs for this analysis are likely [paragraph id = 25] on lock-up agreements and [paragraph id = 69] regarding the impact on share value.\n\n2. **Analyze Lock-Up Agreements (Paragraph 25):**\n   - Paragraph 25 specifies that key shareholders of LEW who will own more than 15% of PubCo Ordinary Shares post-merger (7,241,179 shares) will be subject to lock-up agreements that restrict trading for at least six months and up to twelve months. This aligns with the restriction period mentioned in the statement.\n\n3. **Impact on Share Value and Liquidity (Paragraph 69):**\n   - Paragraph 69 notes that once the lock-up period and any other restricted periods expire, the release of a substantial number of shares may have an adverse effect on the market price of PubCo Ordinary Shares. This indicates potential pressure on share value due to increased liquidity post-lock-up period, rather than during the lock-up period.\n\n4. **Assessing Market Pressure Due to Lock-Up:**\n   - The statement suggests short-term market pressure on share value due to limited liquidity during the lock-up period. The document does not explicitly mention this dynamics of limited liquidity during the lock-up period causing market pressure but instead focuses on potential adverse effects after the lock-up periods expire.\n\nBased on the analysis above:\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe document specifically talks about the potential impact on share value and liquidity only after the lock-up periods end and does not support the claim of short-term market pressure due to limited liquidity during the lock-up period.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

(12% of revenue in 2022) could significantly impact the company's financial condition if they experience financial distress or terminate contracts early (paragraph id = 15).\n\n3. **Contract Termination Clauses:**\n   - The contracts have early termination clauses that can be invoked under certain circumstances, such as destruction of a drilling rig that is not replaced within a specified period or the company's bankruptcy (paragraph id = 19).\n   - The exercise of these clauses could result in early termination payments, but there is no assurance that these payments will be sufficient to cover the company's losses (paragraph id = 19).\n\n4. **Market Opportunities:**\n   - The statement also hints at potential market opportunities. However, this is not explicitly supported by the document. Instead, the document focuses more on risks and uncertainties.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the concentration in the customer base, the high dependence on a few key customers, the presence of early termination clauses, and the cyclical nature of the industry, it is clear that customer credit risk and early termination clauses could materially impact the company's backlog of $82.9 million. The statement accurately reflects the risks outlined in the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

The Company has commitments and contingencies amounting to $127,029 for 2024. It specifies that these amounts are stated in the currencies in which the commitments were made and are estimates based on current currency rates.\n   - Paragraph 39 mentions a note payable (Note B) denominated in Danish Krone (kr), highlighting that the Company deals with foreign currencies and thus is exposed to exchange rate risks.\n\n3. **Documenting Reasoning**:\n   - The statement suggests that the reported commitments and contingent liabilities of $127,029 for 2024 are based on a fixed currency assumption.\n   - The document indeed states that the commitments are estimated in the currencies in which they were made and are subject to the current exchange rates.

(\u201cSH Oversea\u201d), to sell 90 percent ownership of HF Int\u2019l Education and its subsidiaries for $900 (RMB 5,850).\n   - On the same date, HFUS entered a contract with SH Oversea and another individual to sell 100 percent ownership of HZHF and its subsidiaries for $1,000 (RMB 6,500).\n\n2. **Analysis of Sales Price**:\n   - The sales prices are $900 for HF Int\u2019l Education and $1,000 for HZHF, which are extremely low compared to typical business valuations, especially for multiple subsidiaries.\n\n3. **Context of the Sale**:\n   - Paragraph id = 10 and paragraph id = 24 mention that these sales were impacted by government regulations in the education industry and restrictions imposed by the Chinese government to control the pandemic. The sales were intended to avoid further operation losses.\n   - Paragraph id = 27 states that HFSH had payable balances to SH Oversea, a related party, in the amounts of $3,321,300 and $3,291,324 as of January 31, 2024, and July 31, 2023, respectively, indicating significant financial transactions between these entities.\n\n4. **Potential Financial Distress and Non-Arm's Length Terms**:\n   - The sales prices being much lower than typical market values suggest that the transactions may not have been conducted at arm's length.\n   - The context indicates financial distress due to operation losses and efforts to manage related-party transactions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement accurately reflects the information provided in the financial document. The sale of HF Int\u2019l Education and HZHF subsidiaries at nominal prices suggests financial distress and non-arm's length terms, likely aiming to manage related-party receivables and avoid further operation losses.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

Paragraph 115 supports this increase in the valuation allowance with data points showing the additive effect leading to the end-of-year balance. \n3.

A high lease liability and a short weighted-average remaining lease term of 0.9 years, alongside a discount rate of 8%, suggest an aggressive leasing strategy that may stress cash flow and affect future taxable income.\n4.

This confirms the significant increase in the valuation allowance.\n\n2. **Constraints in utilizing deferred tax assets:**\n   - The increase in valuation allowance suggests that the company is less likely to realize its deferred tax assets, indicating constraints in utilizing them. This part of the statement is supported by the data.\n\n3. **High operating lease liabilities of $138 due to a short weighted-average remaining lease term of 0.9 years:**\n   - In paragraph [112], we can see that the operating lease liabilities, current, are indeed $138 for the year 2023.\n   - In the same paragraph, the weighted-average remaining lease term is stated as 0.9 years.\n   - However, the lease liabilities are not necessarily \"high\" just because the remaining lease term is short. This part of the statement is factually correct but misleading.\n\n4. **Weighted-average discount rate of 8%:**\n   - The weighted-average discount rate is also stated as 8% in paragraph [112]. This part of the statement is supported by the data.\n\nNow, let's assess the statement as a whole. While the individual components of the statement are mostly factual, the conclusion that high operating lease liabilities are due to the short remaining lease term is not supported. The increase in valuation allowance does indicate constraints in utilizing deferred tax assets, but tying this to the operating lease liabilities and their terms is not backed by the given data.\n\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, the statement is refuted."

There is no decrease in the fair value of gold holdings mentioned in the document.\n3. **Realized Gains from Gold Sales**: From paragraph [19], we can see that there were realized gains from gold sales during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2023 ($1,537,276 and $4,786,535, respectively). However, there were no net investment losses reported during the same periods.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the given statement is not supported by the provided financial document.

            " ### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Step 1: Identifying Relevant Information in the Document\n- **Internal Control Weakness:** Paragraph id = 52 and 53 discuss the material weakness in internal control related to a deferred tax liability.\n- **Non-Performing Loans:** Paragraph id = 45 provides information about non-performing loans and non-performing assets.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyzing the Internal Control Weakness\n- **Description of Weakness:** The document states, \"The material weakness in internal control over financial reporting resulted from the lack of controls which allowed for the Company to erroneously maintain a deferred tax liability, which it will not be required to recapture.\" (Paragraph id = 53)\n- **Remediation Efforts:** The company is actively working to fix this weakness, and the management believes the new controls will address the issue.\n\n#### Step 3: Verifying Non-Performing Loans Information\n- **Non-Performing Loans Data:** According to paragraph id = 45, the total non-accrual loans and real estate owned are listed as zero for December 31, 2023.\n  - Non-accrual loans: $ \u2014\n  - Real estate owned: $2,312\n- **Total Non-Performing Assets:** $2,312 as of December 31, 2023\n\n#### Step 4: Assessing the Statement\n- The statement claims that the internal control weakness related to the improper maintenance of a deferred tax liability was corrected, and it did not affect the total non-performing loans, which were maintained at zero as of December 31, 2023.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe document supports the existence of an internal control weakness related to the deferred tax liability. However, the document does not directly mention any correction related to this weakness affecting non-performing loans. Since the non-performing loans were indeed zero as of December 31, 2023, the statement about their amount is correct.\n\nTherefore, the document neither explicitly confirms nor contradicts the connection between correcting the internal control weakness and the state of non-performing loans. However, the fact that non-performing loans were zero as of December 31, 2023, is accurate.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

Whether the company is heavily reliant on consumer gifting trends and affected by macro-economic conditions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Impairment Charge of $19.8 Million**:\n   - From Paragraph ID 11: \"During the quarter ended December 31, 2023... the Company determined that an impairment assessment was required for this tradename. This assessment resulted in the Company recording a non-cash impairment charge of $19.8 million to reduce the recorded carrying value of the PersonalizationMall tradename.\"\n   - From Paragraph ID 58: \"During the quarter ended December 31, 2023... the Company determined that an impairment assessment was required for this tradename. This assessment resulted in the Company recording a non-cash impairment charge of $19.8 million to reduce the recorded carrying value of the PersonalizationMall tradename.\"\n\n   Both paragraphs confirm that an impairment charge of $19.8 million was recorded for the PersonalizationMall tradename in fiscal 2023.\n\n2. **Liquidity Risk**:\n   - Paragraph ID 56: \"Overall, broader macro-economic conditions continue to impact our consumers as they continue to moderate their discretionary income. Consumers remain pressured by persistent inflation, higher interest rates, and the resumption of student loan repayments.\"\n   - Paragraph ID 56 also mentions a decrease in total consolidated revenues by 8.4% to $822.1 million and 9.2% to $1.09 billion during the three and six months ended December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\n   While the paragraphs mention macro-economic conditions impacting the company, they do not directly state that the impairment charge is indicative of significant liquidity risk.\n\n3. **Reliance on Consumer Gifting Trends and Macro-Economic Conditions**:\n   - Paragraph ID 56: \"Consumers remain pressured by persistent inflation, higher interest rates, and the resumption of student loan repayments.\"\n   - Paragraph ID [72] shows a decrease in net revenues for the Consumer Floral & Gifts segment by 8.0%.\n\n   These paragraphs indicate that the company is affected by macro-economic conditions and there is a decline in consumer spending, which is critical for companies heavily reliant on consumer gifting trends.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the impairment charge of $19.8 million for the PersonalizationMall tradename is confirmed, the document does not explicitly state that this charge is indicative of significant liquidity risk. However, it does show that the company is affected by macro-economic conditions and consumer spending trends. Therefore, the statement is partially supported by the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

It states:\n   ```\n   For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a significant number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination.\n   ```\n   This directly supports the idea that even after acquiring 100% of a target, the original shareholders might end up with less than 50% voting power due to the issuance of new shares.\n\n3. **Additional Support from Paragraph 30**:\n   Paragraph 30 mentions that the future management team may not have the same level of control or experience:\n   ```\n   Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following our initial business combination remains to be determined... Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of our initial business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination.\n   ```\n   This indirectly supports the idea that control and influence, including voting power, might shift due to the complexities of negotiations and new share issuances.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   Based on the analysis of paragraphs 27 and 30, the provided financial document supports the statement that the outcome of a business combination could result in a situation where, despite acquiring 100% of a target company, the original shareholders end up with less than 50% voting power post-transaction due to the issuance of new shares.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

Paragraph 105 outlines Rising Star Company's significant indebtedness, showing total debt of $421.7 million and the long-term capital risks associated with their financial structure.\n2.

Let's break down the statement into its key components and analyze each part based on the document:\n\n1. **Managing to fully mitigate inflationary impacts**:\n   - The financial document states in paragraph id = 143: \"However, we continue to monitor the inflationary environment and impacts on our operations and have taken measures to mitigate the impact of these inflationary pressures.\"\n   - This indicates that the company is taking measures to mitigate inflationary impacts, but it does not explicitly state that they have been fully mitigated.\n\n2. **Reduced interest rate exposure risks due to variable rate debt**:\n   - Paragraph id = 105 mentions: \"Our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flow.\"\n   - Paragraph id = 219 states: \"While the current expectation is to maintain the interest rate swap through maturity, due to risks for hedging gains and losses, cash settlement costs or changes to our capital structure, we may not elect to maintain the interest rate swap with respect to our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate interest rate risk.\"\n   - These points indicate that there are risks associated with variable rate debt, but the company uses interest rate swaps to manage these risks.\n\n3. **Shrinking transaction-related costs, particularly if the ongoing Merger does not close**:\n   - Paragraph id = 128 mentions: \"If there is any delay in the consummation of the Merger, these costs could increase significantly. Further, if the Merger is not completed, in certain circumstances, we could be required to pay a termination fee of $20 million.\"\n   - This indicates that if the Merger does not close, there could be significant costs, including a potential $20 million termination fee, which contradicts the idea of shrinking transaction-related costs.\n\n4. **Necessitating further strategic financial interventions to maintain stability**:\n   - The document discusses various risks and potential adverse effects on the company's financial condition, operations, and market price of common stock due to the Merger, indebtedness, and other factors.\n   - This suggests that strategic financial interventions may be necessary to address these risks and maintain stability.\n\nBased on the analysis of the financial document:\n\n- The company is taking measures to mitigate inflationary impacts but has not explicitly stated that they have been fully mitigated.\n- There are risks associated with variable rate debt, and while the company uses interest rate swaps to manage these risks, it is not guaranteed that they will fully mitigate interest rate risk.\n- If the Merger does not close, there could be significant transaction-related costs, including a potential termination fee, which contradicts the statement about shrinking transaction-related costs.\n- The document suggests that strategic financial interventions may be necessary to address various risks.\n\n**Conclusion**: The statement is refuted by the financial document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

            " To verify the given statement, we need to analyze the provided financial document and assess whether the ownership of major communities and reliance on long-term supply contracts indeed minimize operational risks and ensure financial stability during global economic downturns. Here are the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Review the Document's Language Concerning Ownership and Long-Term Contracts\n\n#### Ownership of Communities\n- **Paragraph 8:** \"We own, operate, or manage communities.\"\n- **Paragraph 9:** \"Committed Revenue and Exclusivity Produce Highly Visible, Recurring Revenue. The vast majority of our revenues are generated under multi-year contracts that include committed payment terms or exclusivity provisions, under which our customers agree to use our network for all their accommodation needs within the geographies we serve.\"\n\nThese statements confirm the company's ownership (or control through operation or management) of communities and their reliance on long-term contracts.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate How Ownership and Long-Term Contracts Minimize Operational Risks\n\n#### Operational Risks\n- **Paragraph 9:** \"In 2023, approximately 73% of our revenues had committed payment provisions and approximately 99% were under contract, including exclusivity. The weighted average length of our contracts is approximately 45 months and we have maintained a consistent client renewal rate of over 90% for the last 5 years.\"\n\nThis indicates a significant portion of revenue is secured through committed long-term contracts, reducing the risk of revenue fluctuations.\n\n### Step 3: Assess Financial Stability during Economic Downturns\n\n#### Financial Stability\n- **Paragraph 9:** \"Our multi-year contracts and consistent renewal rates provide recurring revenue and high visibility on future financial performance.\"\n- **Paragraph 9:** \"Our business model is generally well insulated from economic cycles. For example, we secured a major new contract in November 2023 for the continued operation of the humanitarian community in Pecos, Texas as well as a renewal and extension in 2020 for another contract, each under our Government Segment which together represents approximately 72% of Target Hospitality\u2019s 2023 revenue.\"\n\nThis suggests that the long-term contracts provide visibility and stability, which can be beneficial during economic downturns.\n\n### Step 4: Review Potential Risks Mentioned in the Document\n\n#### Risks Despite Long-Term Contracts\n- **Paragraph 27:** \"Demand for our services is sensitive to the level of exploration, development and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, natural resource development companies.\"\n- **Paragraph 29:** \"Certain of our major communities are located on land subject to leases. If we are unable to renew a lease, we could be materially and adversely affected.\"\n\nThese statements highlight that while long-term contracts provide stability, there are still risks related to demand fluctuations and lease renewal issues that could impact the company.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the ownership of major communities and reliance on long-term supply contracts do provide a significant level of stability and minimize operational risks, it is not entirely risk-free. Demand fluctuations and lease renewal issues remain as potential challenges. However, the long-term contracts and committed revenue provisions do provide a robust foundation for financial stability.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

The 'Going Concern Assumption' also frames how the company\u2019s ongoing operational viability affects strategic financial decisions.\n6.

            " Sure, let's proceed step by step:\n\n1. **Review the Context**: According to the financial document, Psychemedics Corporation recorded a full valuation allowance on the remaining portion of its deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023.\n\n2. **Relevant Data**:\n   - **Deferred Tax Assets**: The company had gross deferred tax assets of $3.5 million and gross deferred tax liabilities of $0.9 million, resulting in net deferred tax assets of $2.6 million.\n   - **Valuation Allowance**: An offsetting valuation allowance of $2.6 million was recorded against these net deferred tax assets.\n\n3. **Key Point**: The document notes that the valuation allowance was recorded \"due to being in a three-year cumulative loss position, projected future pre-tax book (loss) income and other quantitative and qualitative information.\"\n\n4. **State Tax Credits**: The document also mentions the company had $1.6 million of state net operating loss carryforwards and $1.5 million of California tax credit carryforwards relating to the years 2013 through 2023.\n\n5. **Analysis**: The recording of a full valuation allowance typically indicates a lack of confidence in the realizability of deferred tax assets in the near future. This is contrary to the statement's assertion that the company's decision \"highlights their confidence in future taxable income realization.\"\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The financial document does not indicate any decision to \"eliminate\" the valuation allowance; rather, it discusses the establishment of a full valuation allowance. Moreover, the reasons provided suggest caution regarding future income realization rather than confidence.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

            " To assess the truthfulness of the given statement, we need to analyze the relevant financial data and facts from the provided document:\n\n1. **Chapter 11 Bankruptcy and Liquidation Basis of Accounting:**\n   - Paragraph 96 states, \"On February 10, 2014, the Company, filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code... On March 27, 2014, the court granted the Company\u2019s motion and on that date the Company\u2019s Chapter 11 Case was converted to a Chapter 7 case...the Company adopted liquidation basis of accounting on the discontinued operations according to ASC 205-30.\"\n\n2. **Going Concern Assumption:**\n   - Paragraph 106 states, \"The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the continuation of the Company as a going concern...The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and is dependent on debt and equity financing to fund its operations...management of the Company believes that it will be successful in its capital formation and planned operating activities...there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional equity capital...\"\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The document indicates that Hong Yuan Holding Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2014 and later converted to Chapter 7. This led to the adoption of a liquidation basis of accounting for discontinued operations.\n- Despite this historical event, the company's current financial statements are prepared assuming the continuation as a going concern, which means the management anticipates raising additional funding and continuing operations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The statement correctly highlights a contradiction between the historical liquidation basis of accounting adopted after the Chapter 11 bankruptcy and the current assumption of continuation as a going concern, which is predicated on future equity financing.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

The provided financial document discusses the repurchase of these notes and mentions limitations imposed by credit facilities.\n\n2. **Analyze the Document**:\n   - **Repurchase Details** (Paragraphs 38, 143, 223, 224): The company repurchased $45.0 million of its 5.50% Convertible Secured Notes due 2025 for a total cash purchase price of $44.4 million. This reduced the outstanding borrowings under the note purchase agreement from $83.5 million (as of March 31, 2023) to $40.6 million (as of December 31, 2023).\n   - **Credit Facility Limitations** (Paragraphs 40, 146, 207): The document mentions that the company's revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the 2025 Convertible Notes limit the company's ability to incur or guarantee additional debt, among other restrictions. However, there are no specific details provided about the current debt capacity or the specific covenants that would allow or restrict additional debt after the repurchase.\n\n3. **Reasoning**:\n   - The repurchase of $45 million of notes reduced the company's outstanding borrowings, which could potentially free up some debt capacity under its credit facilities.\n   - However, the document does not provide quantitative details on the debt limits imposed by the credit facilities or the indenture. It is unclear how much additional debt the company is allowed to incur after the repurchase.\n   - Therefore, while the repurchase may have improved the company's debt position, there is not enough information to conclude that it ensures a \"comprehensive ability\" to incur additional debt.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the provided document, it is not explicitly stated that the repurchase ensures the company's comprehensive ability to incur additional debt under existing credit facility covenants. The statement is not directly supported by the given information.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

Paragraph 66 outlines Target Hospitality's adoption of ASC 842 for lease components and ASC 606 for non-lease components, involving critical estimates regarding contract terms and implicit rights, creating potential asymmetrical treatment for revenue recognition.\n2. Paragraph 72 mentions that Target Hospitality recognized $118.2 million of revenue in 2023 from the amortization of advanced payment related to the Expanded Humanitarian Contract, with a significant portion, $62.5 million, recognized over the determined term extending to November 2023.\n3.

            " To verify the statement, we need to analyze the financial documents and focus on the details of the Expanded Humanitarian Contract regarding revenue recognition.\n\n1. **Understanding the Contract**:\n   - Paragraph [17] mentions that Target Hospitality's services are highly customizable and tailored to customer requirements. The document also mentions that the Expanded Humanitarian Contract was signed with a national nonprofit partner (NP Partner) and involved a comprehensive suite of services backed by a committed U.S. Government contract.\n\n2. **Revenue Recognition Policies**:\n   - As per Paragraph [66], Target Hospitality's accounting policy for contracts that contain both lease and service components is to account for the lease component under ASC 842 (Leases) and the non-lease component under ASC 606 (Revenue Recognition).\n   - This means that revenues from leasing activities and revenues from other services should be recognized differently according to their respective accounting standards.\n\n3. **Details of the Expanded Humanitarian Contract**:\n   - Paragraph [72] mentions that approximately $118.2 million of revenue was recognized for the Expanded Humanitarian Contract, which included an advanced payment amortized over the estimated term ending in November 2023.\n   - Out of this, approximately $62.5 million of the revenue was recognized concerning the advanced payment.\n\n4. **Examination of Revenue Recognition**:\n   - If Target Hospitality incorrectly applied ASC 842 exclusively and ignored ASC 606, it would mean that they treated all components of the Expanded Humanitarian Contract as lease obligations. This would imply that the revenue recognition procedure was not correctly bifurcated between lease and service components.\n   - Proper compliance with ASC 842 and ASC 606 would require dividing the contract into its lease and service components and then recognizing the revenue for each according to its specific rules.\n\n5. **Financial Document Evidence**:\n   - The financial document confirms that Target Hospitality adopted an accounting policy to account for and present the lease component under ASC 842 and the non-lease component under ASC 606.\n   - There is no explicit statement in the document mentioning a miscalculation or incorrect application exclusively under ASC 842.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven that the financial document explicitly mentions the correct accounting policy for revenue recognition (using ASC 842 for lease components and ASC 606 for non-lease components) and does not indicate incorrect application or miscalculation, we do not have concrete evidence to support the statement that Target Hospitality miscalculated approximately $62.5 million of revenue from its Expanded Humanitarian Contract by incorrectly applying ASC 842 exclusively.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

            " To assess the truthfulness of the given statement, we need to carefully analyze the relevant financial data provided in the document:\n\n1. **Excess Tax Benefit**:\n   - The statement mentions that \"no excess tax benefit was recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2023\" [paragraph id = 77]. Therefore, there is no direct mention of recognizing an excess tax benefit in the required period.\n\n2. **Net Income Growth**:\n   - The net income for the three months ended December 31, 2023, is $70,803, and for the same period in 2022, it was $63,051. This shows an increase in net income [paragraph id = 18].\n\n3. **Share-Based Compensation Expense**:\n   - The Compensation expense \u2013 equity and liability classified share awards (Note 14) for the nine months ended December 31, 2023, was $126,123, compared to $122,766 for the same period in 2022 [paragraph id = 6]. This shows a slight increase in share-based compensation expense.\n\n4. **Effective Tax Rate**:\n   - The effective tax rate for the nine months ended December 31, 2023, was 26.9%, compared to 20.2% for the same period in 2022 [paragraph id = 124]. The increase in the tax rate is attributed to increased state taxes, taxes due to foreign operations, and the release of the provision for an uncertain tax position.\n\n### Reasoning Process:\n1. **Excess Tax Benefit**: The statement claims that there was an excess tax benefit recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2023. However, paragraph 77 clearly states that \"no excess tax benefit was recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2023.\"\n\n2. **Net Income Growth**: The document confirms that there was a net income growth from $63,051 in 2022 to $70,803 in 2023 for the three months ended December 31.\n\n3. **Share-Based Compensation Expense**: The share-based compensation expense slightly increased, but this increase does not substantially correlate with the significant net income growth or the change in the effective tax rate.\n\n4. **Effective Tax Rate**: The effective tax rate increased significantly, which is explained by increased state taxes, taxes due to foreign operations, and the release of the provision for an uncertain tax position.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the provided financial document, the statement is incorrect because it claims that there was an excess tax benefit recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2023, which contradicts the information in the document. Additionally, the net income growth and the change in the effective tax rate are not primarily influenced by adjustments in share-based compensation expense.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

It also mentions that for unhedged portions, interest expenses increase by $3 million for every 25 basis point rise in SOFR.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Document**:\n   - **Interest Rate Cap (paragraph id = 31, 32, 119)**: The Cap is designed to offset interest rate movements on a portion of the Term Loan. It provides payment if SOFR exceeds 1.436%. The effective portion of the Cap's change in fair value is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, not interest expense.\n   - **Interest Expense Increase (paragraph id = 119)**: The document states that if the SOFR rate rises from the floor to the Cap level, interest expense increases by approximately $3.0 million per quarter. For every 25 basis points increase above the Cap, interest expense increases by an additional $1.6 million annually (not quarterly).\n\n3. **Reasoning**:\n   - The statement seems to have confused the impacts of the Cap and the unhedged portion. The $1.6 million figure is associated with the unhedged portion (for every 25 basis points increase above the Cap), not the Cap itself.\n   - The Cap helps manage exposure to interest rate movements, but the document does not provide a specific figure for the limited increase in annual interest expenses due to the Cap. Instead, it mentions a $3.0 million per quarter increase when the rate rises from the floor to the Cap level.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The statement is refuted based on the provided financial document. The document does not support the claim that the Cap limited the increase in annual interest expenses to only $1.6 million per quarter. Instead, it suggests that interest expenses increase by $3.0 million per quarter when the rate rises from the floor to the Cap level, and by $1.6 million annually for each 25 basis point increase above the Cap for the unhedged portion.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

            " To verify the given statement, we need to analyze the provided financial document and extract relevant information related to the deconsolidation of Aldrich and Murray, the fair value retention, and the establishment of a Qualified Settlement Fund (QSF).\n\n1. **Deconsolidation of Aldrich and Murray**:\n   - Paragraph [76] states that Aldrich (and its subsidiary 200 Park) and Murray (and its subsidiary ClimateLabs) were deconsolidated as of the Petition Date. Their assets and liabilities were derecognized from the Company\u2019s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n2. **Fair Value Retention**:\n   - Paragraph [77] mentions that the Company recorded its retained interest in Aldrich and Murray at fair value, resulting in an aggregate equity investment of $53.6 million as of the Petition Date. No mention of $270.0 million is found in relation to the fair value retention of equity.\n\n3. **Establishment of a Qualified Settlement Fund (QSF)**:\n   - Paragraph [81] indicates that Aldrich and Murray filed a motion to create a $270.0 million trust intended to constitute a QSF. This motion was filed to address the future funding for the Section 524(g) Trust.\n   - Paragraph [82] details that the Company recorded a charge of $21.2 million to increase its Funding Agreement liability to $270.0 million.\n   - Paragraph [83] confirms that the Bankruptcy Court granted the request to fund the QSF, resulting in an operating cash outflow of $270.0 million.\n\nBased on the provided financial document:\n\n- The deconsolidation of Aldrich and Murray is confirmed.\n- The fair value retention in equity is specifically mentioned as $53.6 million, not $270.0 million.\n- The establishment of a Qualified Settlement Fund under IRS Section 468B is confirmed, with the fund amount being $270.0 million.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe statement claims that the Company disclosed a fair value retention of $270.0 million in equity, which is incorrect based on the document provided. The document clearly states the fair value retention as $53.6 million. Therefore, the statement is refuted.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

            " To verify the given statement, we will analyze the provided financial document focusing on the following aspects:\n1. Revenue reliance on long-term government contracts.\n2. Details of the New PCC Contract.\n3. The company\u2019s strategy associated with committed contracts and revenue stability.\n4. The role of committed contracts in providing financial stability amidst uncertainties.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Revenue Reliance on Long-Term Government Contracts\n- **Paragraph 13:** The Government segment generated approximately 72% or $403.7 million of the Company\u2019s revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. This indicates a significant reliance on government contracts.\n\n#### Details of the New PCC Contract\n- **Paragraph 18:** The New PCC Contract includes a one-year base period through November 15, 2024, with an option to extend for up to four additional one-year periods, and an option to extend for up to six months upon the conclusion of the base period or any of the option periods.\n  - **Minimum Revenue Commitment:** $178 million annually.\n  - **5-Year Cumulative Minimum Revenue Commitment:** Assuming all option periods are exercised, approximately $892 million through 2028.\n  - **Maximum Total Contract Amount:** Approximately $1.8 billion through 2028, inclusive of all potential occupancy-based variable services revenue and assuming all option periods are exercised.\n\n#### Strategy Associated with Committed Contracts and Revenue Stability\n- **Paragraph 9:** \"...approximately 73% of our revenues had committed payment provisions and approximately 99% were under contract, including exclusivity. \u2026 Our multi-year contracts and consistent renewal rates provide recurring revenue and high visibility on future financial performance.\"\n  - This points towards the company\u2019s strategy to secure long-term contracts to ensure financial stability.\n\n#### Role of Committed Contracts in Providing Financial Stability Amidst Uncertainties\n- **Paragraph 9:** \"The vast majority of our revenues are generated under multi-year contracts that include committed payment terms or exclusivity provisions...\"\n- **Paragraph 18 & 13:** The New PCC Contract is designed to provide stable, recurring revenue over an extended period, thus offering financial stability.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe provided financial document supports the statement that Target Hospitality relies significantly on long-term government contracts, including the New PCC Contract, which contributes to an expected $892 million minimum revenue over five years. This strategy aims to leverage committed contracts to ensure financial stability amidst geopolitical and economic uncertainties.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

Although some liberalization is noted, the need for compliance with PRC regulatory approval processes can affect the company's ability to manage funds effectively in RMB.\n3. In paragraph 276, it's mentioned that the business is conducted through a VIE structure in China. VIEs are commonly used by foreign investors to navigate restrictions on foreign ownership in certain industries in China, but they often come with legal uncertainties.\n4. Paragraph 277 refers to increased scrutiny on VIE arrangements and regulatory changes that could alter the operating environment for companies with a China-centric focus, impacting their strategic adaptability.\n5. Paragraph 281 discusses the potential compliance issues regarding overseas listings under the CSRC's oversight, which further complicates the financial and operational strategies of companies operating through VIEs.\n6. The statement incorrectly claims that the legal frameworks are clear and policies are flexible, suggesting minimal risk and enhanced liquidity, which contradicts the documented regulatory uncertainties and strict foreign exchange controls highlighted in the context.

The statement suggests that the directors at FutureFuel Corporation manage executive incentives solely through stock options and balance these with stakeholder interests, aligning short-term and long-term shareholder value, reflecting principles of Agency Theory and Stakeholder Theory.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Document\nTo verify the statement, we need to examine the document for information related to the executive compensation structure, the use of stock options, and the principles underlying these practices.\n\n#### Examining Executive Compensation\n- **Compensation Committee**: The document notes the existence of a compensation committee responsible for determining policies and amounts of compensation for the Company's officers and directors (paragraph id 387). This indicates a formal structure for managing compensation.\n- **Execution of Compensation**: The document mentions consideration of corporate performance and comparative pay practices when determining bonuses (paragraph id 393). This shows that compensation decisions consider both internal and external factors.\n- **Stock Options**: According to the document, there were 4,310,167 options available for grant under the Incentive Plan (paragraph id 324). This implies that stock options are indeed a method used for compensation.\n\nHowever, the document does not explicitly state that the directors are tasked with balancing executive incentives \"solely\" through stock options. Moreover, it does not discuss managing stakeholder interests or using principles of Agency Theory and Stakeholder Theory.\n\n### Step 3: Document Each Step of Reasoning\n1. The document confirms the existence of a compensation committee and outlines the criteria they use to determine compensation.\n2. The availability of stock options is mentioned, indicating that they are part of the compensation strategy.\n3. However, the document does not provide explicit information that compensation balancing is done solely through stock options or that it explicitly balances short-term achievements with long-term shareholder value in the context of Agency Theory and Stakeholder Theory.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude the Analysis\nBased on the provided information, while the document confirms the use of stock options and a structured compensation committee, it lacks explicit details confirming that the directors manage incentives solely through stock options and that they follow the principles of Agency Theory and Stakeholder Theory.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted.\n\n**Conclusion**: \"Therefore, the statement is refuted.\""

However, the provided financial document does not mention IFRS 9 explicitly but instead discusses ASU 2016-13 (Topic 326) and CECL (Current Expected Credit Loss).\n\n2. **Analyze the Document**:\n   - Paragraph [245]: Discusses evaluation of available-for-sale debt securities. It states that if the amortized cost exceeds fair value and the security is expected to be sold, the difference is written down to fair value, and any ACL is written off.\n   - Paragraph [246]: Changes in the ACL on investments are recorded as credit loss expense (or reversal). Losses are charged against the allowance when the uncollectibility of a security is confirmed or when there is an intent or requirement to sell.\n   - Paragraph [276]: Reiterates the same as paragraph [246].\n   - Paragraph [289]: Specifically mentions that the decline in fair value of available-for-sale securities is attributed to changes in interest rates, not credit quality. It states that the company does not intend to sell these securities and does not consider it necessary to provide an allowance for any available-for-sale security at December 31, 2023.\n   - Paragraph [274]: Discusses the adoption of ASU 2016-13, which requires evaluating available-for-sale debt securities for impairment if fair value is less than amortized cost, with any estimated credit losses recorded through a credit loss expense and an allowance.\n\n3. **Reasoning Process**:\n   - The document clearly states in paragraph [289] that the decline in fair value of available-for-sale securities is due to interest rate changes and not credit quality.\n   - The company explicitly mentions that it does not intend to sell these securities and does not consider it necessary to provide an allowance for any available-for-sale security.\n   - There is no mention of $23.155 million in unrealized losses due to credit quality in the provided document.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   Given the information in the document, the statement is not supported.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, interest income was $372,050 ([paragraph id = 55]).\n\n3. **Analyze the Impact of Forward Purchase Agreement:**\n   - The Forward Purchase Agreement (FPA) was terminated on January 22, 2024 ([paragraph id = 57]). Before its termination, the FPA was accounted for as a derivative liability and recognized as an adjustment to fair value at each reporting period. This impacted financial integrity, but it's not explicitly stated as significantly impacting financial integrity or causing any material misstatements.\n\nBy examining the given financial document and analyzing the relevant sections mentioned above, we can conclude that the initial part of the statement (\"Despite facing no internal control issues...\") is refuted, as there were indeed internal control issues.

It mentions that these derivatives use market inputs to derive fair values and manage risks.\n   - Paragraph 69 explains the use of derivatives as effective cash flow hedges under U.S. GAAP and mentions the application of the ASC 848 practical expedients to continue hedge accounting.\n   - Paragraph 23 indicates TransDigm's involvement in the aerospace and defense industry.\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - **Use of Derivatives**: Paragraph 61 confirms that TransDigm uses interest rate swaps, cap, and collar agreements, and foreign currency exchange contracts.\n   - **Application of ASC 848 Practical Expedients**: Paragraph 69 explicitly states that TransDigm applied the practical expedients permissible under ASC 848 to continue hedge accounting for their existing swaps and cap as effective cash flow hedges.\n   - **Risk Mitigation**: Paragraph 61 mentions that these derivatives manage various risks, though it does not specifically state \"exchange rate risks.\" However, the mention of foreign currency exchange contracts implies that exchange rate risks are part of what is being addressed.\n   - **Alignment with Markets**: Paragraph 23 confirms TransDigm's involvement in the aerospace and defense industry, and it can be inferred that managing risks is aligned with the fluctuating nature of these markets.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - All the key points in the statement align with the information presented in the financial document. The document confirms the use of derivatives, the application of ASC 848 practical expedients, the mitigation of risks, and the alignment with defense and commercial aerospace markets.\n\nTherefore, the statement is entailed."

Let's break down the statement into parts and analyze them step by step:\n\n1. **\"Whole Earth Brands, Inc. effectively uses cash flow hedge accounting to stabilize its interest expenses...\"**\n   - The document mentions in paragraph 331 that the Company entered into an interest rate swap to exchange variable for fixed rate interest payments related to the Term Loan Facility. This swap is designated as a cash flow hedge and is considered highly effective. This supports the claim that the company is using cash flow hedge accounting to stabilize its interest expenses.\n\n2. **\"...as indicated by the $1.0 million fair value of an interest rate swap...\"**\n   - Paragraph 331 also mentions that the fair value of the interest rate swap was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet in the amount of approximately $1.0 million. This supports the given statement.\n\n3. **\"...that offsets the risk of fluctuating rates on its $183.3 million term loan...\"**\n   - The notional value of the term loan mentioned in the statement matches the $183.3 million figure mentioned in paragraphs 219 and 331. The purpose of the interest rate swap is to reduce future interest rate volatility of the variable rate interest payments related to the Term Loan Facility, as mentioned in paragraph 219. This supports the given statement.\n\n4. **\"...despite the term loan's fair value being $20.4 million lower than its carrying value as of December 31, 2023.\"**\n   - To verify this part of the statement, we need to find the fair value and carrying value of the term loan as of December 31, 2023. According to NOTE 7: DEBT in paragraph 315, the carrying value of the term loan as of December 31, 2023, is $364,688 thousand. However, the document does not provide the fair value of the term loan. Without this information, we cannot confirm or refute this part of the statement.\n\nSince the document does not provide the fair value of the term loan, we cannot fully verify the entire given statement. However, based on the available information, the first three parts of the statement are entailed (supported) by the document.\n\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, the statement is neither fully entailed nor refuted based on the provided financial document due to insufficient information about the term loan's fair value."

It does not detail a registration exemption under Section 4(2) specifically for 3,333,333 shares.\n- **Paragraph ID 59**: Talks about compensation warrants but does not mention registration details.\n- **Paragraph ID 60**: Covers an employee option grant commitment but does not address registration.\n- **Paragraph ID 137**: Discusses financing activities but does not provide details on any specific registrations under Section 4(2).\n- **Paragraph ID 144**: Mentions changes in internal controls but is not relevant to the statement.\n\nThe most pertinent paragraph for our analysis is **Paragraph ID 144 (Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds)**:\n\n> During the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company accepted the exercise of 3,333,333 warrants at $0.01 per share of common stock, for gross cash proceeds of $33,334. The common shares were not registered under the Act and were issued in reliance upon the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(2) of the Act since the transactions were not a part of any public offering.\n\n#### Step 3: Document Each Step of the Reasoning Process\n1. **Identify the relevant paragraph**: Paragraph ID 144 discusses the issuance of 3,333,333 shares resulting from the exercise of warrants.\n2. **Analyze the details**: The paragraph states that these shares were not registered under the Act and were issued under the exemption contained in Section 4(2) of the Act.\n3. **Compare with the statement**: The statement in question mentions the same number of shares and the same exemption provision.\n\n#### Step 4: Conclude the Analysis\nThe document clearly states that 3,333,333 shares were issued under the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. This matches the statement exactly.\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

[...]. Non-producing leaseholds are amortized over the life of the leases using a straight-line method; however, when leases are impaired or condemned, an appropriate adjustment to the provision is made at that time.\"\n     - This indicates that impairment evaluations are a consideration when reserves become uneconomic to produce.\n\n   - **Paragraph ID 54**: \"As disclosed in Supplemental Schedule 1 [...], working interests in oil extensions and discoveries were not adequate to replace working interest reserves produced in 2023 or 2022.\"\n     - This confirms the inadequate replacement of working interest reserves.\n\n   - **Paragraph ID 76**: \"The proved oil and natural gas properties balance was $11,923,496 as of December 31, 2023, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, amortization and valuation allowance.\"\n     - This indicates that depreciation, depletion, and impairment are indeed calculated and recorded.\n\n4. **Reasoning**:\n   - The document clearly states that impairment evaluations are necessary when reserves become uneconomic. Given the inadequate replacement of reserves in 2023, there should be a consideration for impairment evaluations.\n   - The fact that the proved oil and natural gas properties balance includes depreciation, depletion, amortization, and valuation allowance suggests that these calculations are impacted by such evaluations.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   Based on the provided document, the statement claiming that The Reserve Petroleum Company did not need to perform any impairment evaluations despite inadequate replacement of working interest reserves in 2023 and that this had no impact on depreciation and depletion calculations is refuted by the text. The document explicitly mentions the need for impairment evaluations when reserves are uneconomic and shows that depreciation, depletion, and impairment are part of the company's accounting practices.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

This is contradicted by [paragraph id = 56], which states that the company received a CE mark and is working towards ongoing compliance.\n   - The exploration of different regulatory pathways in China is correctly noted, as indicated in [paragraph id = 73].\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** based on the provided financial document.

            " 1. **Reading the Context and Statement:**\n   - The financial document discusses an impairment assessment for the PersonalizationMall tradename leading to a non-cash impairment charge of $19.8 million due to a decline in actual and projected revenue, and higher discount rates resulting from a higher interest rate environment.\n   - The company's working capital was $202.5 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $312.0 million at December 31, 2023.\n   - The statement to verify claims a cash impairment charge (not non-cash) due to decreased discount rates (contradicting higher discount rates in the document), and the use of working capital of $152.9 million (which is the figure for July 2, 2023, not December 31, 2023).\n\n2. **Analyzing the Document:**\n   - Paragraphs 11, 23, 58, 111 explicitly mention a non-cash impairment charge due to higher discount rates.\n   - Paragraph 117 details working capital and cash equivalents at December 31, 2023, and July 2, 2023.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**\n   - The document mentions a non-cash impairment charge, contradicting the \"cash impairment\" claim.\n   - The document reports higher discount rates due to higher interest rates, opposing the \"decreased discount rates\" mentioned in the statement.\n   - The working capital figure used in the statement ($152.9 million) corresponds to an earlier date (July 2, 2023), not the relevant period end (December 31, 2023).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The analysis finds multiple contradictions between the statement and the document. The statement inaccurately describes the impairment charge, the cause of discount rate changes, and the relevant working capital figure.\n\n   Therefore, the statement is refuted."

It also mentions the preparation of Q1 2024 financials in Inline XBRL.\n\n2. **Locate the certification information**: In the document, paragraphs 31 and 32 list certifications under Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, signed by Kara G.

It mentions: \"The fair value of HP\u2019s short- and long-term debt was $ 9.3 billion [...] at January 31, 2024.\"\n   - This section suggests that HP accounts for fair value in its Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets, but it does not specify the exact adjustments made by interest rate swaps.\n\n3. **Check for Specific Fair Value Adjustments:**\n   - The statement suggests a specific negative fair value adjustment of $142 million resulting from interest rate swaps.\n   - Neither paragraph 68 nor 71 directly mentions a negative fair value adjustment of $142 million. The document does not provide specific numerical details about the fair value adjustments related to interest rate swaps.\n\n4. **Fair Value Hierarchy Classification:**\n   - The document states that short- and long-term debt would be classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy if measured at fair value. However, the statement specifically states a fair value adjustment in a \"Level 2 fair value hierarchy context.\" This context matches, but the specific adjustment amount is not mentioned in the document.\n\n5. **Summary of Findings:**\n   - The document confirms that HP Inc. uses interest rate swaps and includes fair value adjustments in its financial reporting.\n   - However, the provided document does not specify a negative fair value adjustment of $142 million.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe statement claims a specific negative fair value adjustment of $142 million resulting from interest rate swaps, which is not mentioned in the provided document.

[...] The Company assessed the combination of the pre-existing senior secured term loan and secured convertible loan in accordance with ASC 470 Debt and determined the transaction should be accounted for as an extinguishment of debt, in part as the Consolidation Term Loan eliminated a substantive conversion feature. In aggregate the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of $295.\"\n   - This clearly indicates that the consolidation loan's extinguishment resulted in a **loss** of $295, not a gain.\n\n2. **Warrant Issuance and Bifurcated Derivative:**\n   - Paragraph ID 219 states: \"The Company issued to Slipstream a warrant to purchase an aggregate of 1,731,499 shares of Company common stock (the \u201cLender Warrant\u201d). The Lender Warrant has a five-year term [...] The warrants were assessed in accordance with ASC 470 and ASC 815 Derivatives and were deemed to represent bifurcated derivative instruments that should be recorded as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. [...] The Company recorded a debt discount associated with each of the Acquisition and Consolidation Term Loans in an amount of $2,032 and $2,190, respectively.\"\n   - This indicates that the warrant issuance resulted in recording a debt discount and did not reflect a valuation adjustment of $295 in the sense described by the statement. The amounts recorded for the debt discount were $2,032 and $2,190.\n\n3. **Loss Related to Debt Discounts:**\n   - Paragraph ID 217 further reinforces: \"In aggregate the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of $295 during the year ending December 31, 2022, primarily associated with the write-off of pre-existing debt discounts.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the Consolidation Term Loan did not record a gain due to extinguishment; instead, it recorded a loss of $295.

            " Sure, let's carefully analyze the financial document to see if it supports the given statement.\n\n### 1. Carefully Read the Given Context and Statement\nThe statement to verify is:\n\"The pursuit of tax-free reorganizations under Sections 368(a)(1) or 351 of the Internal Revenue Code by the Company might allow it to promptly offer audited financial statements despite new management transition, leading to significant equity dilution for existing shareholders.\"\n\n### 2. Focus on the Relevant Data\nThe paragraphs that might be relevant to the statement are:\n- Paragraph 15 (Regarding tax-free reorganizations)\n- Paragraph 13 (Acquisition Interest)\n- Paragraph 17 (Regarding equity dilution)\n- Paragraph 19 (Regarding audited financial statements)\n\n### 3. Document Each Step of Your Reasoning Process\n- **Paragraph 15** mentions: \"While the actual terms of a transaction cannot be predicted, it is expected that the parties to any business transaction will find it desirable to avoid the creation of a taxable event and thereby structure the business transaction in a so-called \u201ctax-free\u201d reorganization under Sections 368(a)(1) or 351 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d). In order to obtain tax-free treatment under the Code, it may be necessary for the owner of the acquired business to own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. In such event, our stockholders would retain less than 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This would result in significant dilution in the equity of our stockholders.\"\n  - This paragraph confirms that tax-free reorganizations under Sections 368(a)(1) or 351 might lead to significant equity dilution for existing shareholders.\n\n- **Paragraph 13** mentions: \"We may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, or licensing agreement with another company or entity.\"\n  - This paragraph suggests that the company may pursue such reorganizations.\n\n- **Paragraph 19** mentions: \"We will not acquire or merge with any company for which audited financial statements cannot be obtained within a reasonable period of time after closing of the proposed transaction.\"\n  - This paragraph confirms that the company requires audited financial statements for any transaction, but it does not directly support the idea that new management would allow for prompt audited financial statements.\n\n### 4. Conclusions\nBased on the paragraphs above:\n- Paragraph 15 confirms the likelihood of significant equity dilution due to tax-free reorganizations under Sections 368(a)(1) or 351.\n- Paragraph 19 confirms the need for audited financial statements but does not support the connection to new management allowing for prompt offering of such statements.\n\nThe statement as a whole is partially supported. While the document does discuss tax-free reorganizations leading to significant equity dilution, it does not directly link this to the ability to promptly offer audited financial statements due to new management transition.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** because the document does not establish a clear link between new management and the prompt offering of audited financial statements in the context of tax-free reorganizations leading to equity dilution."

The extension strategy suggests a calculated decision not solely to extend the deal-making period but also to manage potential accounting impacts and risks associated with warrant liabilities.\n6.

            " To verify the given statement, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the extension deposits made by Canna-Global Acquisition Corp into the Trust Account.**\n   - The document mentions two extension deposits:\n     - The first extension deposit is mentioned in paragraph 10: \"$0.045 per outstanding share of Canna-Global\u2019s Class A common stock.\"\n     - The second extension deposit is mentioned in paragraph 240: \"$0.040 per outstanding share of Canna-Global\u2019s Class A common stock.\"\n\n2. **Calculate the total amount of extension deposits.**\n   - To find the total amount, we need to know the number of outstanding shares of Canna-Global\u2019s Class A common stock. This number is mentioned in paragraph 238 as 20,630,630 shares (after redemption).\n   - However, this number does not align with the deposit amounts mentioned in the Notes to Financial Statements. The actual number of shares used for the deposit calculations seems to be different.\n   - From Note 240, the second extension deposit is $44,506, which corresponds to $0.040 per share. This implies that the number of shares used for this calculation is approximately 1,112,650 (i.e., $44,506 / $0.040).\n   - Assuming the same number of shares for the first extension deposit, the total deposit for the first extension would be approximately $50,067 (i.e., 1,112,650 shares * $0.045).\n   - Therefore, the total extension deposits would be approximately $94,573 (i.e., $50,067 + $44,506).\n\n3. **Compare the calculated total with the given total in the statement.**\n   - The statement mentions a total of $178,024, which does not match our calculated total of approximately $94,573.\n\n4. **Assess the strategic intent mentioned in the statement.**\n   - The strategic intent mentioned in the statement is not explicitly discussed in the document. The document does not provide information about deferring equity liabilities, mitigating potential financial statement impacts under ASC 815, or the risk of Public Warrants expiring without value if no Business Combination is achieved.\n\nBased on these steps, the statement is refuted because the total extension deposits do not match the given total, and the strategic intent mentioned in the statement is not supported by the document.\n\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, the statement is refuted."

Here are the steps to follow:\n\n1. **Evaluate Working Capital Position**: Working capital is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities. However, since we don't have the balance sheet, we can infer changes in working capital from the cash flow statement and other relevant notes.\n\n2. **Examine Related Party Transactions**: The statement mentions improvements due to related party transactions. We should look for any related party transactions in the financial statements.\n\n3. **Assess Revenue Generation**: The statement also mentions consistent revenue generation from transactions involving a major shareholder's relatives. We should examine the revenue figures and check for any related party revenue.\n\nLet's analyze the document:\n\n- **Working Capital Position**:\n  - In the \"Cash flows from financing activities\" section, it's noted that there were \"Proceeds of related party notes payable\" of $36,000 in 2024 and $60,000 in 2023.\n  - Additionally, \"Advances from related parties\" were $971 in 2024.\n  - These inflows could suggest an improvement in liquidity, but without the full balance sheet, we can't definitively calculate the working capital or its change over time.\n\n- **Related Party Transactions**:\n  - The \"Cash flows from financing activities\" section shows related party transactions (notes payable and advances) totaling $36,971 in 2024 and $60,000 in 2023.\n  - However, the \"Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\" also show a \"Revenue - Related Party\" of $62,443 for both the three-month and six-month periods ending January 31, 2024. This indicates significant related party revenue.\n\n- **Revenue Generation**:\n  - The document shows that revenue from related parties was $62,443 in the given period. This indicates revenue generation from related parties.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the document, there are significant related party transactions that include both revenue and advances/notes payable, which could contribute to an improved liquidity position. However, the term \"improving working capital position\" typically implies a comparison over time, which cannot be definitively confirmed without specific balance sheet figures for both periods. The statement also mentions \"consistent revenue generation,\" but the document only provides figures for 2024, making it difficult to confirm consistency over time.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted** due to the lack of sufficient information to confirm an \"improving working capital position\" and the consistency of revenue generation over time."

            " ### Step 1: Read the Context and Statement\nThe financial document provides detailed information about the company's performance across various segments and regions. The statement to verify is about the impact of inflationary costs on the gross margins of the Light Vehicle and Commercial Vehicle segments.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Relevant Data\nWe need to focus on sections that mention gross margins, inflationary costs, and segment-specific data for the Light Vehicle and Commercial Vehicle segments.\n\n#### Gross Margins:\n- **Light Vehicle Segment (2022 vs 2023):**\n  - 2022 Margin: 3.9%\n  - 2023 Margin: 5.3%\n\n- **Commercial Vehicle Segment (2022 vs 2023):**\n  - 2022 Margin: 2.2%\n  - 2023 Margin: 4.2%\n\n#### Inflationary Costs:\n- **Light Vehicle Segment:**\n  - \"Inflationary cost increases of $187\" (Paragraph 121)\n  - Costs partially offset by performance-related earnings increases\n\n- **Commercial Vehicle Segment:**\n  - \"Inflationary cost increases of $22\" (Paragraph 124)\n  - Costs partially offset by performance-related earnings increases\n\n### Step 3: Document the Reasoning Process\n1. **Gross Margins Analysis:**\n   - Both the Light Vehicle and Commercial Vehicle segments saw an increase in gross margins from 2022 to 2023.\n   - Light Vehicle: 3.9% (2022) to 5.3% (2023)\n   - Commercial Vehicle: 2.2% (2022) to 4.2% (2023)\n\n2. **Inflationary Costs Impact:**\n   - The document mentions inflationary cost increases in both segments.\n   - Light Vehicle: $187 increase in inflationary costs\n   - Commercial Vehicle: $22 increase in inflationary costs\n\n3. **Overall Performance:**\n   - Despite facing increased inflationary costs, both segments saw an increase in gross margins.\n   - This indicates that the company was able to manage its cost structure effectively, possibly through cost savings and pricing actions.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe statement suggests that the company faced challenges in its cost structure leading to a decline in gross margins due to inflationary costs. However, the financial document shows an increase in gross margins in both segments despite increased inflationary costs.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

Those factors and the maturing of the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport's interest-rate swap, contributed to an unrealized loss of approximately $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to an unrealized gain of approximately $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n     ```\n     This section indicates there was an unrealized loss of approximately $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, due to the interest rate swaps.\n\n   - **Cash Equivalents:**\n     In the document, the \"Consolidated Balance Sheets for Sotherly Hotels Inc.\" (F-4) lists cash equivalents:\n     ```\n     December 31, 2023: $17,101,993\n     December 31, 2022: $21,918,680\n     ```\n\n3. **Reasoning Process:**\n   - **Interest Rate Swaps:** The document actually reports an unrealized loss of $0.7 million for 2023, contrary to the statement claiming an increase in fair value due to favorable interest rates.\n   - **Cash Equivalents:** The balance sheet shows a decrease in cash equivalents from $21,918,680 in 2022 to $17,101,993 in 2023, which contradicts the claim that Sotherly Hotels maintained a substantial portion of its cash equivalent balance.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The statement is contradicted by the provided financial document.

Paragraph 42 supports understanding of shareholder dynamics, indicating that despite acquiring full control, existing shareholders could own a minority of the entity after new shares are issued to facilitate the acquisition.\n4. Valuation multipliers, often used to gauge fair market value, could impact ownership percentages and trigger minority shareholder outcomes, aligning with reverse merger characteristics.\n5.

However, the document does not explicitly state that the focus is on \"high grant-date fair value.\" Instead, it provides details on various grant dates and their respective fair values.\n   - The document does mention grant dates and fair values, such as the July 2023 RSU Grant with a fair value of $3.85 and the April 2021 RSU Grant with various vesting events.\n   - The statement suggests that this unrecognized expense does not significantly impact financial statements based on fair value accounting conventions. The document does not provide a direct comparison or analysis to support this claim.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The document confirms the $315 thousand unrecognized stock compensation expense for nonvested PSUs and RSUs.\n   - However, the document does not explicitly mention a strategic focus on high grant-date fair value RSU issuances, nor does it provide a direct analysis of the impact of this expense on financial statements based on fair value accounting conventions.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

However, it does mention that shareholders may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company depending on the valuations ascribed to the target and the pre-business combination company (paragraph id = 27).\n\nGiven these points, let's assess the statement:\n\n- The statement mentions that if the board determines the target meets the 80% fair market value threshold using a private offering of convertible debt, the board is required to obtain an independent opinion.\n- However, the document states that an independent opinion is only required if the board cannot independently determine the fair market value. It does not mention that using a private offering of convertible debt automatically requires an independent opinion.\n- The statement also mentions \"despite no shareholder dilution\". However, the document does not provide a direct link between shareholder dilution and the requirement for an independent opinion.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided document, the statement is not entirely accurate as it implies a specific condition (using convertible debt and no shareholder dilution) that requires an independent opinion, which is not explicitly stated in the document.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, the statement is refuted."

It states, \"We believe that the introduction of more powerful GPUs, CPUs and similar computer hardware... has a significant effect on the demand for our products.\"\n\n2. **Impact on Demand**:\n   - **[paragraph id=64]**: The document indicates a historical positive effect of new hardware on Corsair's products, stating, \"historically, new generations of high-performance GPUs and CPUs have positively affected the demand for our products.\" However, it also acknowledges uncertainty about future impact.\n   - **[paragraph id=84]**: Further reinforces that changes in the frequency of new hardware introductions and their acceptance by gamers can materially affect Corsair Gaming's business.\n   - **[paragraph id=241]**: Mentions that the \u201cdemand for gaming components and systems products was primarily driven by the availability of new and reasonably priced GPUs and CPUs as well as the release of new game titles.\u201d\n\n3. **Need for Strategic Alliances**:\n   - The document does not directly discuss strategic alliances and their dependency on the decline in gaming hardware innovation. However, it mentions competitive pressures and the need to adapt to technological changes and market demands.\n   - **[paragraph id=104]**: Discusses reliance on a small number of manufacturers for key components, highlighting potential risks associated with single-source suppliers.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nCorsair Gaming's dependency on gaming hardware innovation is acknowledged, and the document discusses how this innovation drives demand for their products. However, the document does not provide any direct information about how a decline in hardware innovation would \"directly negate the need for strategic alliances\" or discuss \"cross-elasticity effects within the gaming hardware ecosystem.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the provided financial document, the statement cannot be supported or refuted directly due to the lack of explicit information on the relationship between hardware innovation, strategic alliances, and cross-elasticity effects.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, the statement is **refuted** based on the available information in the document."

However, the decrease is mainly due to share redemptions and not dividend payments.\n   - The statement also suggests that this decrease underscores market volatility risks in SPAC operations. While the decrease does show a significant change in the trust account balance, the document does not provide enough information to directly tie this to market volatility.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement is not entirely accurate as it misattributes the cause of the decrease in the trust account balance and makes an unsupported claim about market volatility risks.

            " To verify the given statement, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check the financial covenants mentioned in the document.**\n   - According to paragraphs [108] and [236], the 2022 Credit Agreement requires Masco Corporation to maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.5 to 1.0.\n\n2. **Confirm compliance with the covenant as of the latest date.**\n   - Paragraph [108] states that Masco Corporation was in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2023. This includes the interest coverage ratio covenant.\n\n3. **Verify the fair value and carrying value of debt.**\n   - Paragraph [242] indicates that the aggregate estimated market value (fair value) of Masco's short-term and long-term debt was approximately $2.6 billion, while the aggregate carrying value was $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2023. This confirms that the fair value of debt was lower than its carrying value.\n\n4. **Assess the company's operational earnings relative to its interest obligations.**\n   - To maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.5 to 1.0, Masco Corporation must have strong operational earnings relative to its interest obligations. The interest coverage ratio is calculated as Operating Income / Interest Expense.\n   - From the Consolidated Statements of Operations (paragraph [153]), we can see that Masco Corporation had an operating profit of $1,348 million and interest expense of ($106) million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This gives an interest coverage ratio of 12.72 (1,348 / 106), which is well above the required 2.5 to 1.0.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the given statement is accurate. The company's compliance with the interest coverage ratio covenant indicates strong operational earnings relative to its interest obligations, which mitigates concerns over debt valuation discrepancies.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

As of December 31, 2023, there are no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.\"\n     - This confirms the company is exposed to interest rate changes but does not mention significant impact or strategic management related to cash holdings due to interest rate exposure.\n\n   - **Credit Facility Covenants:**\n     - Paragraph id = 44: \"The Credit Facility requires the Company to comply with certain financial and performance covenants...\"\n     - Paragraph id = 150: \"The Credit Facility requires the Company to comply with certain financial and performance covenants...\"\n     - Both paragraphs mention covenants but do not discuss strategic management of these covenants.\n\n   - **Net Cash Outflow:**\n     - Paragraph id = 155: \"For the nine months ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in financing activities was $1.9 million, primarily due to payment of capital leases of $2.3 million.\"\n     - The cash flow table shows:\n       - Net cash used in financing activities for 2023: $ (47,040) thousand\n       - Net cash used in financing activities for 2022: $ (1,850) thousand\n       - This indicates a significant cash outflow in financing activities for 2023, not minimal repayments on long-term debt.\n\n   - **Adherence to Covenant Requirements:**\n     - Paragraph id = 45: \"As of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.\"\n     - Paragraph id = 151: \"As of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.\"\n     - These paragraphs show no outstanding borrowings but do not discuss adherence to covenant requirements in detail.\n\n3. **Reasoning Process:**\n   - The statement mentions significant impact from interest rate exposure on cash holdings, but the document only discusses exposure without specifying significant impact.\n   - The statement refers to strategic management of credit facility covenants, but the document does not detail strategic management related to cash holdings or interest rate impact.\n   - The statement claims minimal repayments on long-term debt as the primary cause of net cash outflow, while the document shows significant financing activities outflow not specifically related to minimal repayments.\n   - The document mentions covenants but does not directly link adherence to these covenants with the net cash outflow or management strategies.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   Based on the provided document, the statement is not supported by the information. Key elements of the statement, such as significant impact from interest rate exposure, strategic management of covenants, and minimal repayments causing net cash outflow, are not explicitly confirmed. Therefore, the statement is refuted.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

Paragraph 8 explains that the Company uses Level 2 inputs for certain financial instruments like cash equivalents and derivatives, utilizing observable market data such as interest rates and bond yields.\n3. Paragraph 10 describes how the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to calculate lease liabilities because the leases do not provide an implicit rate, linking it to observable market trends.\n4. Paragraph 11 adds that for leases, the Company is using observable market data to estimate future base rate escalations, reflecting consistent application of external market data in financial strategies.\n5. Paragraph 16 identifies derivative financial instruments using Level 2 measurements, aligning with the strategy disclosed in paragraph 8.\n6. Together, this indicates a strategic alignment between using market-based assumptions in evaluating both fair value of financial instruments and calculating lease obligations.\n7. The statement is incorrect because lease accounting indeed relies on observable market data, such as the incremental borrowing rate, aligning financial assumptions with market conditions. The claim about using internal estimations regardless of market conditions for lease accounting does not align with the context, where observable market trends are applied.",

            " 1. **Analyzing the Statement:**\n   The statement claims two things:\n   - The Company's reliance on Level 2 fair value measurement for cash equivalents and derivatives involves using market data.\n   - Lease accounting employs internal estimations regardless of market conditions, diverging financial assumptions from market conditions.\n\n2. **Examining the Document:**\n\n   - **Cash Equivalents and Derivatives (Level 2 Fair Value Measurement):**\n     - Paragraph 8 states: \"The Level 2 cash equivalents include money market funds, commercial paper and short-term U.S. agency securities... In determining fair value of Level 2 assets, the Company uses a market approach utilizing valuation models that incorporate observable inputs such as interest rates, bond yields and quoted prices for similar assets.\"\n     - This confirms that the Company uses market data for Level 2 fair value measurements of cash equivalents and derivatives.\n\n   - **Lease Accounting:**\n     - Paragraph 10 mentions: \"ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Certain leases contain variable contractual obligations as a result of future base rate escalations which are estimated based on observed trends... The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\"\n     - This implies that while there are internal estimations (such as using the incremental borrowing rate), the process also considers market conditions (observed trends) to estimate variable payments.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The document supports that Level 2 fair value measurements for cash equivalents and derivatives use market data.\n   - However, lease accounting does not entirely disregard market conditions, as it considers \"observed trends\" for estimating variable payments, which contradicts the statement that it relies solely on internal estimations regardless of market conditions.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

            " 1. **Understanding the Context and Statement:**\n   - The context provided detailed HealthEquity's financial arrangements, particularly focusing on their Enhanced Rates offerings and their relationships with insurance company partners and Depository Partners.\n   - The statement to verify is: \"HealthEquity's reliance on fully insured HSA cash held with insurance company partners, along with the reputational risks associated with guaranteeing these funds, could solidify the company's brand integrity and financial stability, should an adverse event occur.\"\n\n2. **Analysis of the Document:**\n   - **Insurance of HSA Cash:**\n     - The financial document states that the HSA cash held through insurance company partners is **not federally insured** (paragraph 69).\n     - The members bear the risk of loss with respect to the failure of the insurance company partner or the breach by the partner of its obligations.\n   - **Reputational and Financial Risks:**\n     - If a failure or breach by an insurance company partner occurs, it could result in reputational and financial harm to the company (paragraph 70).\n     - The document does not state that reliance on insurance company partners \"could solidify the company's brand integrity and financial stability.\"\n\n3. **Reasoning Process:**\n   - The document explicitly mentions the **lack of federal insurance** for HSA cash with insurance company partners, which contradicts the notion of \"fully insured\" cash.\n   - The risk of failure or breach by the insurance company partners is presented as a potential source of harm rather than a safeguard for the company's brand integrity and financial stability.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the information provided, the statement contradicts the financial document. The document clearly states the risks and lack of insurance for HSA cash held with insurance company partners, which refutes the notion that this reliance could solidify brand integrity and financial stability.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."
