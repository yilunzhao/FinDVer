Here are the steps to verify each part of the statement:\n\n### Step 1: Verify total assets at fair value as of December 31, 2023\n\n**Financial Document Extract (Paragraph ID = 93):**\n```\n| Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized as follows:\n\n| Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets | Significant Other Observable Inputs | Significant Unobservable Inputs |\n| (Thousands) | (Level 1) | (Level 2) | (Level 3) | Total |\n| As of December 31, 2023 |\n| Assets: |\n| Physical commodity contracts | $ | \u2014 | $ | 9,893 | $ | \u2014 | $ | 9,893 |\n| Financial commodity contracts | 29,056 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 29,056 |\n| Money market funds | 86 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 86 |\n| Other | 3,111 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 3,111 |\n| Total assets at fair value | $ | 32,253 | $ | 9,893 | $ | \u2014 | $ | 42,146 |\n```\n\nBased on the above extract, the total assets measured at fair value as of December 31, 2023, are $32,253 thousand in Level 1 fair value hierarchy.\n\n### Step 2: Verify long-term debt carrying value of solar sale leasebacks\n\n**Statement to verify:** The long-term debt carrying value of solar sale leasebacks amounts to $278.4 million, categorized within the Level 2 fair value hierarchy.\n\n**Financial Document Extract Analysis:**\n- The provided financial document does not explicitly state the carrying value of long-term debt related to solar sale leasebacks.\n- The only references to fair value measurements are detailed in Paragraph ID 93.\n- Further, there is no mention of $278.4 million in the document or any specific categorization of long-term debt within the Level 2 fair value hierarchy.\n\nSince the document does not provide direct information about long-term debt categorized within the Level 2 fair value hierarchy or a carrying value of $278.4 million for solar sale leasebacks, we cannot confirm this part of the statement from the given document.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed** regarding the total assets at fair value as of December 31, 2023. However, the statement is **refuted** regarding the long-term debt carrying value of solar sale leasebacks since the document lacks sufficient information to support this claim.\n\nThus, the overall conclusion is:\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

There are no paragraphs discussing such initiatives or business activities.\n\n2. **Review information about the EU Emissions Trading Scheme:**\n   - Paragraph id = 48 discusses the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. It mentions that the scheme requires vessels to surrender allowances for a portion of their CO2 emissions and that some revenue from the EU auctions is allocated to the maritime sector to support innovation in low-carbon technologies.\n   - The statement claims that all revenue is allocated to sectors outside maritime innovations, which contradicts the information provided in the document.\n\nBased on the provided financial document, OSG has not mentioned any involvement in transporting liquified CO2 or shifting towards renewable energy.

However, this is not related to the conversion of preferred stock to common stock.\n   - In paragraph [52], there is a mention of \"Share conversion to Class A Common Stock\" with a value of $(72,542), but this does not match the value given in the statement ($578).\n   - There is no mention of $578 related to the conversion of preferred stock to common stock in the given document.\n\n2. **Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023:**\n   - According to paragraph [54], the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023, was indeed $(22,118). This part of the statement is supported by the document.\n\n3. **Significant operating losses:**\n   - Paragraph [54] shows an \"Loss from operations\" of $(26,288) for the year ended December 31, 2023. This supports the claim of significant operating losses.\n\n4. **Working capital:**\n   - Working capital is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities. However, the provided document does not include a complete balance sheet with current assets and liabilities, so we cannot directly calculate the working capital.\n   - The statement claims a working capital of $1.3 million, but there is no direct evidence to support this in the given document.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the claim about the net loss is supported by the document. However, the claims about the conversion of preferred stock to common stock and the working capital are not directly supported or refuted due to insufficient or unrelated data in the provided document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **neither fully entailed nor fully refuted** based on the given financial document."

The collateral for workers' compensation claims showed a slight increase rather than a decrease.\n\n"

Insider Trading Arrangements\nThe statement mentions \"insider trading arrangements.\" Let's search the document for any discussion related to insider trading, share issues, or stock transactions involving the company\u2019s directors.\n\n- From the document, we see discussions about:\n  - Stock options exercised ([paragraph id=75] and others)\n  - Conversion of debt obligations to Class A Common Stock ([paragraph id=65])\n  - Shares issued for consulting services ([paragraph id=65])\n  - Warrants exercised ([paragraph id=65])\n  - Proceeds from equity sale ([paragraph id=65])\n  - Stock-based compensation ([paragraph id=65])\n\nThere is no explicit mention of \"insider trading arrangements\" as a specific term, but there is evidence of share-based activities and transactions involving company shares.\n\n#### 2. Executive Team and Principal Executives\nThe statement also mentions the presence of an executive team with principal executives like William Santana Li and Robert Mocny. Let's check these names in the document:\n\n- William Santana Li is mentioned multiple times in the document:\n  - As the Chief Executive Officer and sole director of the Company ([paragraph id=85])\n  - As Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President ([paragraph id=106])\n\n- Robert Mocny is mentioned as a director:\n  - In the signing section ([paragraph id=106]).\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the document contains information about stock activities and share transactions, there is no explicit mention of \"insider trading arrangements\" as a term. The document clearly identifies William Santana Li and Robert Mocny in the roles mentioned in the statement, confirming their presence in the executive team and as directors.\n\nOverall, the first part of the statement (regarding insider trading arrangements) is not explicitly supported by the document, while the second part (regarding the executive team) is confirmed by the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** due to the lack of explicit mention of \"insider trading arrangements.\""

Here are the steps to follow:\n\n1. **Identify Revenue Composition**:\n   - Check the revenue contribution of the U.S. Concrete Pumping segment to total revenue.\n   - Determine if the U.S. Concrete Pumping segment accounts for 72% of total revenue.\n\n2. **Brand Contribution**:\n   - Look for information that indicates the significant reliance on Brundage-Bone and Capital Pumping brands within the U.S. Concrete Pumping segment.\n\n3. **Fleet Size**:\n   - Verify the fleet size of the U.S. Concrete Pumping segment and its contribution to the global fleet as of October 31, 2023.\n\nLet's analyze the document accordingly:\n\n### 1. Revenue Composition\nFrom [paragraph id = 103], we have:\n- Total revenue for the year ended October 31, 2023: $442,241,000\n- Revenue from U.S. Concrete Pumping: $317,877,000\n\nCalculation of revenue percentage:\n- Percentage of U.S. Concrete Pumping in total revenue = (317,877 / 442,241) * 100 \u2248 71.9%\n\n### 2. Brand Contribution\nThe document does not explicitly state the reliance on Brundage-Bone and Capital Pumping brands, but it does mention the brands in the context of competitive dynamics:\n- From [paragraph id = 23], it is stated that the concrete pumping industry is highly fragmented and competitive, with several competitors including larger regional companies and small independent businesses, which may imply significant brand reliance on names like Brundage-Bone and Capital Pumping.\n\n### 3. Fleet Size\nThe document does not specifically mention the fleet size of 1,760 units for the U.S. Concrete Pumping segment or the global fleet of 1,580 units.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the given information:\n- The U.S. Concrete Pumping segment does constitute a significant portion of the total revenue, at approximately 71.9%, which is close to the stated 72%.\n- There is no explicit mention of the significant reliance on Brundage-Bone and Capital Pumping brands, though the competition dynamics imply their importance.\n- The specific fleet sizes provided in the statement are not corroborated by the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is partially supported by the provided financial document regarding the revenue percentage but lacks explicit support for the brand reliance and fleet size claims.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities vs. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities (Q1 2024):**\n\nWe need to refer to the section of the document labeled \"[paragraph id = 104] Cash Flows\".\n\n- Net cash provided by/used in:\n  - Operating activities (Q1 2024): $(122) million (negative indicates cash used)\n  - Investing activities (Q1 2024): $(47) million\n\nFrom this data, we see that net cash used in operating activities was $(122) million, and net cash used in investing activities was $(47) million. This shows that **net cash used in operating activities ($122 million) was significantly larger than net cash used in investing activities ($47 million)**. This part of the statement is clearly refuted based on the provided financial data.\n\n**2. Declaration of a $0.25 per share dividend:**\n\nThere is no mention of a dividend declaration in any part of the provided document. Therefore, we cannot confirm or deny this part of the statement based on the provided information.\n\n**3. Decrease in Total Stockholders' Equity:**\n\nTo determine if there was a decrease in total stockholders' equity, we need information about total stockholders' equity for both Q1 2024 and Q1 2023. However, this specific financial information regarding total stockholders' equity is not provided in the document.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe provided financial document does not support the statement about the company's net cash used in operating activities being \"significantly smaller\" than its net cash used in investing activities. Additionally, the document does not mention any declaration of a $0.25 per share dividend, and there is no data to verify a decrease in total stockholders' equity.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

            " ### 1. Context and the Statement\n\nThe context provided includes the financial documents of Virtual Interactive Technologies Corp. The statement we need to verify is:\n\n> As of September 30, 2023, Virtual Interactive Technologies Corp. held 600,000 treasury shares and reported a decrease in working capital of $3,360,774 compared to September 30, 2022, due to reduced prepaid expenses and increased accounts payable.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Document\n\n#### 2.1 Treasury Shares\n- From the Statement of Changes in Stockholders' Equity (paragraph id 54):\n    - Treasury shares as of September 30, 2023: 691,250 shares.\n    - Treasury shares as of September 30, 2022: 41,250 shares.\n\n- Therefore, the company did not hold 600,000 treasury shares as of September 30, 2023.\n\n#### 2.2 Working Capital\n- Working Capital is calculated as:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Working Capital} = \\text{Current Assets} - \\text{Current Liabilities}\n  \\]\n\n- From the Balance Sheet (paragraph id 52):\n    - Current Assets as of September 30, 2023: $128,443\n    - Current Assets as of September 30, 2022: $2,128,035\n    - Current Liabilities as of September 30, 2023: $1,657,558\n    - Current Liabilities as of September 30, 2022: $1,296,376\n\n- Calculate the working capital for both years:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Working Capital as of September 30, 2023} = 128,443 - 1,657,558 = -1,529,115\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Working Capital as of September 30, 2022} = 2,128,035 - 1,296,376 = 831,659\n  \\]\n\n- Change in working capital:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Decrease in Working Capital} = 831,659 - (-1,529,115) = 2,360,774\n  \\]\n\n- The decrease in working capital is $2,360,774, not $3,360,774.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nAfter verifying the financial documents, we have determined that:\n- The number of treasury shares held as of September 30, 2023, is 691,250, not 600,000.\n- The reported decrease in working capital from September 30, 2022, to September 30, 2023, is $2,360,774, not $3,360,774.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

There was an increase in firearms sales by $1.5 million in fiscal year 2023 compared to 2022, driven by new store openings and a 53-week fiscal year.\n\nLet's address each claim based on the provided financial document:\n\n### Claim 1: Decrease in Same Store Sales by 20% in FY 2023\n\n#### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Identify Relevant Sections for Net Sales:**\n   - Paragraph [192] provides information on net sales across various departments.\n\n2. **Extract Net Sales Data for Analysis:**\n   - The document states: \"Our Camping, Hunting and Shooting, Apparel, Optics, Electronics and Accessories, Fishing and Footwear departments saw decreases in net sales of $31.6 million, $30.1 million, $17.0 million, $11.5 million, $9.5 million and $8.7 million, respectively, for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022.\"\n\n   - It further states that these decreases were primarily caused by inflationary pressures and recessionary concerns leading to a decline in store traffic and lower demand.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Decrease in Net Sales:**\n   - Total net decrease in sales = $31.6M + $30.1M + $17.0M + $11.5M + $9.5M + $8.7M = $108.4M\n\n4. **Calculate Percentage Decrease:**\n   - The total net sales for fiscal year 2023 = $1,399,515 thousand\n   - The total net sales for fiscal year 2022 = $1,506,072 thousand\n   - Decrease in net sales = $1,506,072 thousand - $1,399,515 thousand = $106,557 thousand\n   - Percentage decrease = (Decrease in net sales / Total net sales in 2022) * 100\n   - Percentage decrease = ($106,557 thousand / $1,506,072 thousand) * 100 \u2248 7.1%\n\n#### Conclusion:\n   - The decrease in net sales is approximately 7.1%, not 20%.\n\n### Claim 2: Increase in Firearms Sales by $1.5 Million in FY 2023\n\n#### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Identify Relevant Sections for Firearms Sales:**\n   - Paragraph [192] specifically mentions sales from the firearms category within the Hunting and Shooting department.\n\n2. **Extract Firearms Sales Data:**\n   - The document states: \"Within our Hunting and Shooting department, sales from our firearms category increased by $1.5 million, or 0.5%, for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022.\"\n\n#### Conclusion:\n   - The statement about firearms sales increasing by $1.5 million is explicitly supported by the document.\n\n### Final Determination:\n- **Claim 1 (20% decrease in same store sales):** Refuted (the decrease was approximately 7.1%).\n- **Claim 2 ($1.5 million increase in firearms sales):** Entailed.\n\nOverall, based on the analysis, the statement is refuted due to the first part being incorrect.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

            " To verify the given statement, we need to analyze the provided financial document for the following key points:\n\n1. **Revenue Generation**: Confirm whether the company generated revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2023.\n2. **Stock-Based Compensation Expenses**: Check if stock-based compensation expenses increased significantly.\n3. **Share Issuance**: Verify if the company issued shares as compensation.\n4. **Liquidity Challenges**: Determine if the company overcame liquidity challenges.\n5. **Net Cash Flow from Operations**: Check for positive net cash flow from operations.\n6. **Working Capital**: Ensure that the working capital is positive.\n\nLet's go through each point:\n\n### 1. Revenue Generation\nThe provided financial document does not explicitly mention revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2023. There is no revenue-related information in the given document.\n\n### 2. Stock-Based Compensation Expenses\nThe document mentions stock-based compensation expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2023:\n- Stock-based compensation expense: $610,032 (paragraph id = 96)\n- Stock-based consulting expense: $306,095 (paragraph id = 96)\n\nCombining these, the total stock-based compensation and consulting expenses amount to $916,127, which is significant.\n\n### 3. Share Issuance\nFrom the \"Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders\u2019 Deficit\" for the six months ended December 31, 2023:\n- Shares issued for consulting services: 6,129,999\n- Shares issued as compensation to employees: 5,320,000\n- Shares issued as compensation to directors and officers: 30,960,000\n- Shares issued for conversion of notes payable: 24,246,430\n\nThis confirms that a significant number of shares were issued as compensation.\n\n### 4. Liquidity Challenges\nTo determine if the company overcame liquidity challenges, we need to check the changes in cash, current assets, and current liabilities.\n\n- Cash (December 31, 2023): $8,478\n- Cash (June 30, 2023): $9,982\n- Total current assets (December 31, 2023): $47,371\n- Total current assets (June 30, 2023): $9,982\n- Total current liabilities (December 31, 2023): $4,772,284\n- Total current liabilities (June 30, 2023): $4,263,296\n\nThe document does not provide explicit details on net cash flow from operations. However, we can calculate the change in working capital:\n\n- Working Capital (December 31, 2023): $47,371 - $4,772,284 = -$4,724,913\n- Working Capital (June 30, 2023): $9,982 - $4,263,296 = -$4,253,314\n\nThe working capital is negative for both periods, but we need to examine net cash flow from operations for a clearer picture of liquidity challenges being overcome.\n\n### 5. Net Cash Flow from Operations\nThe document does not provide explicit details on net cash flow from operations for the six months ended December 31, 2023.\n\n### 6. Working Capital\nAs calculated above, the working capital is negative for both periods, indicating ongoing liquidity challenges.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the provided financial document:\n- The company did not generate revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2023.\n- Stock-based compensation expenses significantly increased.\n- The company issued shares as compensation.\n- The company did not overcome liquidity challenges, as evidenced by negative working capital.\n- The document does not provide explicit details on net cash flow from operations.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

Available Borrowings on the Credit Facility\n**Context Examination:**\n- The document does not provide a specific value for available borrowings on the Credit Facility directly within the given sections. However, relevant information can be gleaned if present.\n\nTo continue verifying, we would need to:\n- Check for notes or other detailed sections mentioning the Credit Facility's available borrowings.\n\n**Assuming the provided information includes mentioning the Credit Facility:**\n- Based on the financial document, we should analyze the Financing Activities section for any related disclosure.\n\nHowever, the provided sections:\n- Does not include a specified amount for borrowings based on crease facility directly.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the provided context, let's match the statement:\n\n- Given: Net Income from continuing operations is given as $7,784,000.\n- Given: Cash and cash equivalents are $18,788,000.\n- Non-confirmed: Credit Facility available borrowings are not explicitly provided. Without this, we can still assess the partial evidence.\n\nTherefore, the provided data only partially verifies the statement, specifically on the net income and cash amounts. The Credit Facility availability remains unverified conclusively.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted based on the provided context.**"

However, the actual data shows an increase in net operating income from newly developed and expanded facilities and a significant increase in interest expenses.\n- Therefore, the statement contradicts the provided financial document.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

The financial document does not include any information about dividend payments, suggesting that Paysign, Inc. did not pay dividends during the periods covered in the document.\n\nBased on the provided financial document, we cannot definitively verify the entire statement due to the lack of specific information about stock price fluctuations and insider ownership percentage.

The company navigated significant legal and geopolitical challenges, including expanding lease agreements with Russian airlines despite imposed sanctions.\n2. The company expects to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with possible adverse tax impacts on U.S. shareholders.\n\nLet's analyze the document to find evidence related to these points.\n\n### Part 1: Lease Agreements with Russian Airlines\n\n**Document Analysis:**\n\n- In paragraph [168], it is mentioned that there was \"lower maintenance billings from early termination of aircraft leases with Russian airlines as a result of the sanctions imposed on Russian airlines during the first quarter of 2022.\"\n- In paragraph [184], it states that as of December 31, 2023, \"we own and manage 363 aviation assets, consisting of 96 commercial aircraft and 267 engines, including eight aircraft and seventeen engines that were still located in Russia.\"\n- The document does not mention any expansion of lease agreements with Russian airlines. Instead, it only mentions early terminations and the impact of sanctions.\n\n### Part 2: Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC) Status\n\n**Document Analysis:**\n\n- The document does not explicitly mention that the company expects to be treated as a passive foreign investment company or any possible adverse tax impacts on U.S. shareholders.\n\n### Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Lease Agreements with Russian Airlines:** The document highlights the impacts of sanctions on the company's lease agreements with Russian airlines, which led to early terminations and lower maintenance billings. There is no mention of expanding lease agreements with Russian airlines.\n2. **PFIC Status:** The document does not refer to the company being treated as a passive foreign investment company or any related tax impacts on U.S. shareholders.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe statement claims that the company expanded lease agreements with Russian airlines and expects to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with possible adverse tax impacts on U.S. shareholders. However, the document mentions early terminations due to sanctions and does not provide any information about the company being treated as a passive foreign investment company.

            " To verify the statement, we'll break it down into two main parts and analyze each component using the provided financial document:\n\n1. **$1.1 million increase in operating loss for three months ending December 31, 2023.**\n   - According to the \"CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\" (paragraph id = 1), the operating (loss) income for the three months ended December 31, 2023, was $(1.0) million, compared to $0.1 million for the same period in 2022. This indeed represents a decrease in operating income (or an increase in operating loss) of $1.1 million.\n   - The reason provided for this increase in operating loss is an increase in marketing and development expenses incurred at Marygold & Co. and Original Sprout. This explanation is confirmed in the \"Operating (Loss) Income\" section (paragraph id = 81).\n\n2. **$1.0 million revenue decline for six months largely due to decreased AUM in USCF Investments.**\n   - From the \"CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\" (paragraph id = 1), the total revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2023, was $16,692 thousand, compared to $17,697 thousand for the same period in 2022. This represents a decline of $1,005 thousand (or $1.0 million).\n   - To attribute this decline to decreased AUM (assets under management) in USCF Investments, we can look at the \"SCHEDULE OF CONCENTRATION RISK\" (paragraph id = 12). Although specific AUM values are not provided, we can see that the revenue from USO (a fund managed by USCF Investments) decreased by $1,547 thousand over the six months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. This decrease in USO revenue contributes significantly to the overall revenue decline and suggests that the statement's reasoning is sound.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the given statement is accurate and supported by the data provided in the financial document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

The reduction in debt from $55,136,231 to $41,063,865 is not a $100 million difference.\n\n3. **Planned Future Dividend Payments of $4.5 Million for the Next Fiscal Year:**\n   - The document mentions cash dividends declared for the periods in question. For 2023, cash dividends declared were $0.44 per share. However, there is no explicit mention of planned future dividend payments of $4.5 million for the next fiscal year.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n- The statement about product development focus is supported by the document.\n- The statement about debt payments of $100 million is refuted by the document.\n- The statement about planned future dividend payments of $4.5 million is not supported by the document.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Three Months Ended December 31, 2023:**\n   - Sales and Marketing expense: $57,753 (paragraph id = 146)\n   - Stock-based compensation expense for the same period: $(7,224) (paragraph id = 146)\n   - To find the increase, we compare it with the corresponding period in 2022.\n   - Sales and Marketing expense in 2022: $51,913 (paragraph id = 146)\n   - Stock-based compensation expense in 2022: $(8,663) (paragraph id = 146)\n   - Increase in stock-based compensation expense: $8,663 - $7,224 = $1,439\n\n   The increase in stock-based compensation expense is approximately $1.4 million, which matches the statement's description for the three months ended December 31, 2023.\n\n2. **Six Months Ended December 31, 2023:**\n   - Adjusted Sales and Marketing expense: $96,872 (paragraph id = 146)\n   - The statement mentions that the primary driver was expanded travel and event costs, excluding advertising. However, the table does not provide a detailed breakdown of travel, event costs, or advertising expenses.\n\n   Without the specific breakdown, we cannot conclusively verify the causes of the increase in adjusted sales and marketing expenses for the six-month period.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement is partially supported by the document. The increase in sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2023, is indeed driven primarily by a $1.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. However, for the six months ended December 31, 2023, the document does not provide enough detailed information to confirm that the increase in adjusted sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to expanded travel and event costs, excluding advertising.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed** for the three-month period but cannot be fully verified for the six-month period due to insufficient information."

It also mentions potential impacts of macroeconomic conditions on interest rates.\n- Paragraph id 11 describes how the company leverages its investments and that borrowings under uncommitted repurchase agreements are subject to the discretion of lenders, indicating sensitivity to market conditions.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n- The document does not explicitly provide information on REIT ownership requirements or exemption criteria under the Investment Company Act of 1940.\n- The document does discuss risks related to market conditions and interest rates, which aligns with the third part of the statement.\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** insofar as the document does not clearly establish the need to comply with specific REIT ownership requirements or exemption criteria under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The document does support the notion of risks related to market conditions and interest rates.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

This represents a decrease in net interest income, not an increase.\n\n   **Note**: There was a mistake here; the net interest income decreased, not increased.\n\n2. **Decrease in Investment Banking Fees in Global Wealth & Investment Management Segment:**\n   - From Table 8 (paragraph id = 106), the financials for Global Wealth & Investment Management indicate that investment banking fees decreased from $469 million in 2023 to $708 million in 2024. This shows an increase, not a decrease.\n   - The statement incorrectly mentions a decrease.\n\n3. **Decrease in Noninterest Income in Global Wealth & Investment Management Segment:**\n   - From the same table, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, total noninterest income was $5,202 million, compared to $5,517 million in the same period of 2023. This displays a decrease in noninterest income.\n   - The statement is correct on this point.\n\n4. **Implementation of $2.5 billion Stock Repurchase:**\n   - The statement mentions a stock repurchase of $2.5 billion, but there is no data in the provided financial document to confirm this stock repurchase.\n\n5. **Exceeding Regulatory Net Capital Requirements for U.S. Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries:**\n   - The financial document does not provide explicit information on regulatory net capital requirements for U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries for the first quarter of 2024.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the provided financial document, the statement contains inaccuracies. Specifically, the net interest income decreased, and investment banking fees increased, contrary to what is stated. Additionally, there is no evidence provided regarding the stock repurchase or exceeding regulatory net capital requirements.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

We'll focus specifically on the details about goodwill impairment, cash and cash equivalents, revenue, and operating expenses.\n\n### Goodwill Impairment Charge\n1. **Goodwill Impairment:**\n   - According to the financial document, under the \"Reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA\" section, it states:\n     - **Goodwill impairment (4)**\n     - For the three months ended December 31, 2023: $198,800\n     - For the nine months ended December 31, 2023: $198,800\n\n     This shows that the goodwill impairment charge is $198.8 million, not $98.8 million as stated in the statement.\n\n### Cash and Cash Equivalents\n2. **Cash and Cash Equivalents:**\n   - In the \"CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\" section, the amounts for Cash and Cash Equivalents as of December 31, 2023:\n     - Cash and cash equivalents: $242,418\n\n     This shows that the cash and cash equivalents amount is $242.4 million, not $142.4 million as stated in the statement.\n\n### Revenue and Operating Expenses\n3. **Revenue and Operating Expenses:**\n   - The \"CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\" section shows the following:\n     - **Revenue:**\n       - For the three months ended December 31, 2023: $44,747\n       - For the nine months ended December 31, 2023: $155,610\n     - **Operating Expenses:**\n       - Total operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2023: $301,146\n       - Total operating expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2023: $541,950\n\n     The document does not provide enough context to confirm a \"significant reduction\" compared to the previous year without specific comparable numbers for the previous year. However, the document does include previous year numbers that indicate reductions in revenue and increases in operating expenses.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the provided document:\n- The goodwill impairment charge was $198.8 million, not $98.8 million.\n- The cash and cash equivalents were $242.4 million, not $142.4 million.\n- The statement about significant reductions in revenue and operating expenses lacks sufficient context to be conclusively assessed but based on the numbers provided, there is a reduction in revenue and an increase in operating expenses for the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022.\n\nTherefore, the given statement is **refuted**."

From Table 2, paragraph 2, we find that total noninterest income for the first quarter of 2024 was $11,786 million, compared to $11,810 million in 2023, indicating a slight decrease.\n2. Table 3, paragraph 3, states that investment banking fees increased from $1,163 million in 2023 to $1,568 million in 2024.\n3. Paragraph 3 also shows that despite the increase in investment banking fees, other components like market-making declined, contributing to the slight drop.\n4. From Table 1, paragraph 2, the net income applicable to common shareholders for the first quarter of 2024 was $6,142 million, compared to $7,656 million in 2023, showing a significant drop.\n5. Paragraph 2 again shows an increase in noninterest expenses in 2024 ($17,237 million) compared to 2023 ($16,238 million), contributing to the decreased net income.\n6. The provision for credit losses increased from $931 million in 2023 to $1,319 million in 2024.\n7. These factors together contributed to the drop in net income applicable to common shareholders.\n8. The statement incorrectly claims an increase in noninterest income from 2023 to 2024, while it actually slightly decreased from $11,810 million to $11,786 million.\n9.

            " To assess the truthfulness of the given statement, let's break down the key points and analyze the provided financial document step by step.\n\n### Key Points of the Statement:\n1. Appyea Inc. needs to secure PMA approval to market their Apnea related devices in the US.\n2. Despite financial constraints, they are pursuing unique funding strategies to support their development and distribution efforts.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### 1. PMA Approval Requirement\n- To determine if Appyea Inc. needs PMA approval, we need to look at the regulatory requirements for medical devices.\n- **Paragraph ID 110** states: \"Before we can market a new medical device, such as our proposed Apnea related products, we must first receive clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDA.\"\n  - This statement specifically mentions the requirement for 510(k) clearance, not PMA (Premarket Approval). Therefore, it seems the company is seeking 510(k) clearance, not PMA.\n\n#### 2. Financial Constraints and Funding Strategies\n- To verify if Appyea Inc. is facing financial constraints and is pursuing unique funding strategies, we need to review sections that discuss financial performance and funding.\n- **Paragraph ID 66** states: \"We have generated to date an insignificant amount of revenue from commercial sales to date and our future profitability is uncertain. [...] Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, were $1,817,000 and $1,304,000, respectively, and our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $6,326,000 and $4,509,000, respectively.\"\n  - This paragraph confirms that Appyea Inc. is facing financial constraints with significant losses and an accumulated deficit.\n- **Paragraph ID 192** states: \"From inception, we have funded our operations from a combination of loans and sales of equity. [...] We expect to incur additional costs and require additional capital.\"\n  - This indicates that the company has been using loans and equity sales for funding and expects to need more capital.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the provided document:\n- Appyea Inc. requires 510(k) clearance, not PMA approval, for their Apnea related devices.\n- The company is indeed facing financial constraints and is pursuing funding strategies such as loans and equity sales to support their development and distribution efforts.\n\nTherefore, the statement is partially refuted regarding the PMA approval requirement but entailed regarding the financial constraints and funding strategies.\n\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, the statement is refuted."

The Trust Account holds approximately $10.65 per Public Share as of December 31, 2023.\n\n2. **Non-Redemption Agreements and Share Details**:\n   - Paragraph [140] mentions non-redemption agreements involving 4,998,734 Public Shares. This is relevant to understand that a significant number of shares were not redeemed.\n   - Paragraph [196] provides shareholder information, particularly the beneficial ownership.\n\n3. **Balance Sheet**:\n   - In the Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2023, the total assets are listed as $55,427,237, compared to $216,798,844 in the previous year.\n   - The \"Cash (Investments) held in Trust Account\" shows $55,347,556 as of December 31, 2023.\n\n4. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - The Cash Flow Statement shows a significant withdrawal (redemption) from the Trust Account of $169,088,048.\n\n   Next, let's verify the given statement details:\n\n### Statement Details:\n- Redemption of 10,045,860 shares at approximately $10.54 per share.\n- Reduction of the Trust Account by $169.1 million.\n- Total assets ending at $55,427,237 as of December 31, 2023, compared to $216,798,844 the previous year.\n\n### Verification Steps:\n\n1. **Redemption Price Calculation**:\n   - The statement claims redemption at approximately $10.54 per share.\n   - From the Balance Sheet, the Trust Account is approximately $10.65 per Public Share as of December 31, 2023.\n\n   This matches closely enough to the state price calculation.\n\n2. **Number of Shares Redeemed**:\n   - The statement mentions 10,045,860 shares were redeemed.\n   - Cash Flow Statement shows a withdrawal of $169,088,048, which roughly translates to the redemption of 10,045,860 shares at $10.54 per share.\n\n   Calculation:\n   \\[\n   10,045,860 \\text{ shares} \\times \\approx 10.54 \\text{ per share} \\approx 105,900,000\n   \\]\n   Although the exact figure doesn\u2019t match precisely, it\u2019s reasonably close.\n\n3. **Trust Account Reduction**:\n   - The Cash Flow Statement shows a Trust Account withdrawal of $169,088,048.\n   - The statement mentions a reduction of $169.1 million, which matches the financial data.\n\n4. **Total Assets**:\n   - The Balance Sheet confirms total assets of $55,427,237 as of December 31, 2023, and $216,798,844 the previous year.\n\nHence, the details in the statement match the information provided in the financial documents.

The change in deferred subscription revenue.\n2. The change in consolidated adjusted EBITDA.\n3. The cash flows from operating activities and working capital changes (if provided).\n\nLet's go through each point step by step:\n\n### 1. Deferred Subscription Revenue\n\nFirst, we need to identify the deferred subscription revenue from the balance sheets for November 30, 2023, and November 30, 2022.\n\n**From the balance sheet:**\n- Deferred subscription revenue on November 30, 2023: $83,484\n- Deferred subscription revenue on November 30, 2022 (assuming it is the same as August 31, 2023, as we don't have the full year data for 2022): $95,386\n\nNow, let's calculate the percentage change:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Change} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{New Value} - \\text{Old Value}}{\\text{Old Value}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Change} = \\left( \\frac{83,484 - 95,386}{95,386} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Change} = \\left( \\frac{-11,902}{95,386} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Change} \\approx -12.48\\% \\]\n\nThe percentage change is approximately -12.48%, not -14%.\n\n### 2. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA\n\nNext, we need to identify the consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the quarters ended November 30, 2023, and November 30, 2022.\n\n**From the financial statements:**\n- Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended November 30, 2023: $10,969\n- Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended November 30, 2022: $11,472\n\nLet's calculate the change in consolidated adjusted EBITDA:\n\\[ \\text{Change} = 11,472 - 10,969 = 503 \\]\n\nThe change in consolidated adjusted EBITDA is $503, a decrease from $11,472 to $10,969.\n\n### 3. Cash Flows from Operating Activities and Working Capital Changes\n\nThe statement mentions strong cash flows from operating activities driven by favorable working capital changes. However, we do not have detailed cash flow statements in the provided document. Therefore, we cannot verify this part of the statement.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the provided financial document:\n- The statement about a 14% decrease in deferred subscription revenue is incorrect; the actual decrease is approximately 12.48%.\n- The statement about a decrease in consolidated adjusted EBITDA from $11.5 million to $11.0 million is accurate; the actual decrease is from $11,472 to $10,969.\n- We cannot verify the part about strong cash flows from operating activities driven by favorable working capital changes due to the lack of cash flow data.\n\nTherefore, the statement is partially accurate but ultimately refuted due to the incorrect percentage change in deferred subscription revenue.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

            " To verify the statement, we need to check the following claims against the provided financial document:\n\n1. Earth Science Tech, Inc. significantly increased its assets.\n2. The company reduced its current liabilities from $1,437,943 to $957,476.\n3. The company achieved substantial revenue growth.\n4. The business volume decreased by December 31, 2023.\n\nLet's analyze each claim step by step:\n\n1. **Increase in Assets:**\n   - Assets on December 31, 2023: $3,245,655\n   - Assets on December 31, 2022: $537,376\n   - The assets increased by $3,245,655 - $537,376 = $2,708,279.\n   - This is a significant increase in assets.\n\n2. **Reduction in Current Liabilities:**\n   - Current liabilities on December 31, 2023: $957,476\n   - Current liabilities on December 31, 2022: $1,437,943\n   - The current liabilities decreased by $1,437,943 - $957,476 = $480,467.\n   - This confirms the reduction in current liabilities as stated.\n\n3. **Substantial Revenue Growth:**\n   - Revenue for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023: $3,790,112\n   - Revenue for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022: $2,533\n   - The revenue increased by $3,790,112 - $2,533 = $3,787,579.\n   - This indicates substantial revenue growth.\n\n4. **Business Volume Decrease by December 31, 2023:**\n   - The provided document does not define \"business volume\" explicitly. However, if we consider \"business volume\" in terms of revenue or overall operations, the revenue for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023 ($3,790,112) is significantly higher than for December 31, 2022 ($2,533).\n   - Therefore, the claim of a decrease in business volume is not supported by the given revenue data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe financial document supports the significant increase in assets, the reduction in current liabilities, and substantial revenue growth. However, the statement about a decrease in business volume is not supported by the documented revenue growth.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

            " To verify the statement, we need to examine the relevant sections of the financial document to find evidence of the dispute resolution with Harper & Jones, LLC.\n\n1. **Cash Payment of $300,000**: We should look for any mention of a cash payment made in relation to Harper & Jones, LLC.\n\n2. **Issuance of 78,103 shares of common stock**: We should check the sections detailing stock transactions to confirm the issuance of these shares.\n\n3. **Return of 100% ownership of Harper & Jones, LLC**: This might be mentioned in sections detailing the company\u2019s holdings or any major transactions.\n\n### Analyzing the Financial Document:\n\n1. **Cash Payment of $300,000**:\n   - The financial document does not explicitly mention a cash payment of $300,000 related to Harper & Jones, LLC. However, we can infer from the section on contingent consideration liability (paragraph 93) that there was a resolution related to Harper & Jones for $1,400,000. This amount is not directly $300,000, but it suggests some form of settlement.\n\n2. **Issuance of 78,103 shares of common stock**:\n   - In the stockholders\u2019 equity section (paragraph 88), there is a mention of \"Issuance of common stock pursuant to disposition\" where 78,103 shares were issued. This matches the statement.\n\n3. **Return of 100% ownership of Harper & Jones, LLC**:\n   - There is no explicit mention of returning 100% ownership of Harper & Jones, LLC in the document. However, the settlement agreement and the issuance of shares suggest some action related to Harper & Jones, LLC.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the document mentions a settlement with Harper & Jones, LLC and the issuance of 78,103 shares of common stock, it does not explicitly state a cash payment of $300,000 or the return of 100% ownership. Therefore, the statement is not entirely supported by the document.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

However, the statement incorrectly claims a significant increase in operating income margin, as the actual operating income margin decreased to (19.3)%. Additionally, the claim of impairment charges for goodwill and trade name is supported by the data.\n\n**Final Determination:**\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** due to the incorrect assertion about the increase in the operating income margin."

However, the attribution to inflationary pressures, particularly in labor, is not explicitly supported by the provided financial document. Therefore, while the quantitative aspects of the statement are accurate, the causal attribution cannot be verified from the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is partially entailed and partially not verifiable.

This could limit the company's ability to pay dividends.\n\n2. **Borrowings Outstanding**:\n   - Paragraph [300] confirms that at December 31, 2022, the company had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.\n\n3. **Dividend Payments**:\n   - The Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity (paragraph [57]) show that the company paid common stock dividends of $349,028 in 2022.\n\nBased on the provided document, while it is true that the company had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at the end of 2022, the company is indeed limited in its ability to declare dividends due to the financial ratio requirements and default conditions outlined in the Amended Agreement.

            " To verify the given statement, we need to examine the financial document and determine whether the following claims are supported:\n\n1. In fiscal 2023, Kirkland's reported a slight operating gain.\n2. There was a decrease in outstanding borrowings in fiscal 2023.\n3. Kirkland's implemented a financial turnaround strategy.\n4. The turnaround strategy was aided by a Term Loan Agreement drawn from Gordon Brothers Group.\n\nLet's analyze each claim step by step:\n\n### Claim 1: Kirkland's reported a slight operating gain in fiscal 2023.\n- **Relevant Data**: The \"Consolidated Statements of Operations\" section (paragraph id = 191).\n- **Analysis**:\n  - Operating (loss) income for 53 Weeks Ended February 3, 2024 (Fiscal 2023): $(24,414) thousand.\n  - Operating (loss) income for 52 Weeks Ended January 28, 2023 (Fiscal 2022): $(42,751) thousand.\n  - Operating (loss) income for 52 Weeks Ended January 29, 2022 (Fiscal 2021): $25,345 thousand.\n\n  Comparing the operating income for Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, Kirkland's reported a smaller operating loss in Fiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022. However, it is still a loss, not a gain.\n\n### Claim 2: There was a decrease in outstanding borrowings in fiscal 2023.\n- **Relevant Data**: The \"Consolidated Balance Sheets\" section (paragraph id = 190).\n- **Analysis**:\n  - Revolving line of credit for February 3, 2024: $34,000 thousand.\n  - Revolving line of credit for January 28, 2023: $15,000 thousand.\n\n  There was an increase in the revolving line of credit from $15,000 thousand to $34,000 thousand, indicating an increase in outstanding borrowings, not a decrease.\n\n### Claim 3: Kirkland's implemented a financial turnaround strategy.\n- **Relevant Data**: The \"Business Strategy\" section (paragraph id = 1).\n- **Analysis**: The document mentions rebalancing the value proposition and re-engaging the customer base, which suggests a focus on improving the financial position, but it does not explicitly mention implementing a financial turnaround strategy impacting borrowings.\n\n### Claim 4: The turnaround strategy was aided by a Term Loan Agreement drawn from Gordon Brothers Group.\n- **Relevant Data**: No specific mention of a Term Loan Agreement with Gordon Brothers Group is found in the document.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis:\n1. Kirkland's reported a smaller operating loss in Fiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022, but it was not a gain.\n2. There was an increase in outstanding borrowings in fiscal 2023.\n3. The document mentions strategies to improve financial position but does not explicitly state a financial turnaround strategy.\n4. There is no mention of a Term Loan Agreement with Gordon Brothers Group.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

However, the actual decrease is 22%.\n2. **Currency Fluctuations**: The document does not provide information on currency fluctuations affecting the company's financial performance.\n3. **Operating Margins**: The statement suggests operating margins potentially fell, but the data shows an improvement from an operating loss to an operating profit.\n4. **Price-to-Cost Ratio**: The document does not provide data to support the statement regarding the price-to-cost ratio.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude the Analysis\n\nBased on the provided financial document:\n1. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses was 22%, not 18.9%.\n2. There is no information on currency fluctuations.\n3. The operating margins improved from a loss to a profit, contradicting the statement.\n4. There is no data on the price-to-cost ratio.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted.\n\n### Final Determination\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

However, we can infer some information from the \"Accumulated other comprehensive income\" (paragraph id = 222 and 223).\n\n#### Amounts Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income:\n\n- For **pension benefit** in **2023**:\n  - Net (loss)/gain: **$(35,084,405)**\n  - Prior service (cost) credit: **$-**\n\n#### Change in the Components of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income:\n\n- **Balance at the beginning of the period (2023)**: **$(36,956,587)**\n- **Charged to net periodic benefit cost (2023)**:\n  - **Prior service cost**: **$-**\n  - **Net loss (gain)**: **$1,371,460**\n  - **Liability (gains)/losses**:\n    - **Discount rate**: **(1,794,084)**\n    - **Asset (gains)/losses deferred**: **2,431,940**\n    - **Other**: **(137,134)**\n\n- **Balance at the end of the period (2023)**: **$(35,084,405)**\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Net Deferred Income Tax Liability**:\n   - The document confirms that the net deferred income tax liability in 2023 is **$2,283,571**.\n\n2. **Pension Benefit Obligation**:\n   - The document shows changes in the pension benefit obligation through comprehensive income data. Specifically, the **balance at the end of the period** for pension benefit is **$(35,084,405)**.

The document clearly states 2008.\n\n### Operational Stage\n- The document repeatedly refers to ProtoKinetix as \"A Development Stage Company.\" (Multiple instances, such as paragraph id = 124 and 125)\n  - This supports the statement that ProtoKinetix, Inc. is a development stage company.\n\n### Revenue Information\n- The document details various expenses but does not explicitly state revenue figures. (Statements of Operations, for example, show only expenses and losses)\n  - The absence of revenue figures in the provided data suggests the company has not generated significant revenue, aligning with the development stage company status.\n\n### Going Concern Uncertainties\n- The document mentions \"Basis of Presentation \u2013 Going Concern Uncertainties\" under Notes to Financial Statements.

Cash used in operating activities for the same period in 2023.\n\nLet's examine each point:\n\n1. **Net loss for the six months ended February 29, 2024:**\n   - In the \"Consolidated Statements of Operations,\" the net loss for the six months ended February 29, 2024, is given as $(451,319).\n\n2. **Net loss for the corresponding period in 2023:**\n   - In the \"Consolidated Statements of Operations,\" the net loss for the six months ended February 28, 2023, is given as $(2,267,700).\n\n3. **Cash used in operating activities for the six months ended February 29, 2024:**\n   - In the \"Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows,\" the net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended February 29, 2024, is given as $(39,697).\n\n4. **Cash used in operating activities for the same period in 2023:**\n   - In the \"Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows,\" the net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended February 28, 2023, is given as $(664,737).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The net loss for the six months ended February 29, 2024, is $(451,319), which is a decrease compared to the net loss of $(2,267,700) for the corresponding period in 2023.\n- The net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended February 29, 2024, is $(39,697), which is also a decrease compared to the $(664,737) for the same period in 2023.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe given statement claims that the company faced an increased net loss of approximately $2,267,700 for the six months ended February 29, 2024.

Therefore, we cannot confirm this part of the statement based on the given data.\n\n2. **Ongoing operating losses:** The document shows that 23andMe Holding Co. has been incurring operating losses. This can be seen in the \"Reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA\" section:\n   - For the three months ended December 31, 2023, the net loss was $277,976 thousand.\n   - For the nine months ended December 31, 2023, the net loss was $457,870 thousand.\n\n3. **Substantial R&D investments:** The document shows significant research and development expenses:\n   - For the three months ended December 31, 2023, R&D expenses were $93 million (93% of revenue).\n   - For the nine months ended December 31, 2023, R&D expenses were $102 million (102% of revenue).\n\n4. **Expiration of the GSK Agreement:** The document mentions that the exclusive target discovery term of the GSK Agreement concluded in July 2023. However, it also mentions that 23andMe will continue to collaborate with GSK on a number of ongoing programs and that they entered into an amendment to the GSK Agreement in October 2023.\n\n5. **Impact of GSK Agreement expiration on revenue:** While the exclusive term of the agreement has expired, the document does not provide sufficient information to conclude that this did not significantly impact revenue. In fact, the document states that \"Substantially all our research services revenue in the periods presented was derived from the GSK Agreement.\" Additionally, the document mentions that they had deferred revenue of $20.0 million related to the 2023 GSK Amendment as of December 31, 2023.\n\nBased on the given document, while 23andMe has been incurring operating losses and investing significantly in R&D, it is not accurate to say that the expiration of the GSK Agreement did not significantly impact revenue. The document suggests that the company is still generating revenue from the GSK Agreement and its amendment. Also, the document does not provide information about PIPE investments or merger proceeds.\n\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, the statement is refuted."

Significant improvement in revenues due to the reopening of hotels\n- **Paragraph ID 299:**\n  - Revenues from \"Rooms\" in fiscal 2023: $106,618\n  - Revenues from \"Rooms\" in fiscal 2022: $107,699\n- **Revenues Comparison (Paragraph ID 171):**\n  - Total revenues in fiscal 2023: $729,575\n  - Total revenues in fiscal 2022: $677,394\n  - Increase in total revenues: $52.2 million (7.7%)\n- **Conclusion:** There is an increase in total revenues, but the revenue from \"Rooms\" slightly decreased, not indicating a significant improvement due to the reopening of hotels.\n\n### 3. Decreased expenses from corporate items due to compensation\n- **Paragraph ID 299:**\n  - Administrative costs in fiscal 2023: $78,565\n  - Administrative costs in fiscal 2022: $74,755\n  - Increase in administrative costs: $3,810\n- **Conclusion:** Administrative costs increased, which contradicts the statement about decreased expenses from corporate items due to compensation.\n\n### 4. Permanent closures of some theatres\n- **No Specific Mention:** The document does not explicitly mention permanent closures of some theatres.\n- **Conclusion:** There is no evidence to support the statement regarding permanent closures of some theatres.\n\n### Final Determination\n- The statement suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic did not materially impact the company's results in fiscal 2023, but the document does not provide explicit information to confirm this.\n- The statement mentions significant improvement in revenues due to the reopening of hotels, but the revenues from \"Rooms\" actually decreased slightly.\n- The statement claims decreased expenses from corporate items due to compensation, but administrative costs increased.\n- There is no mention of permanent closures of some theatres.\n\nGiven these points, the provided financial document does not support the statement.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

This aligns with the statement's mention of opportunistic acquisitions and dispositions to enhance invested capital.\n\n**Step 2: Assess the revenue structure**\n- The Company's revenue structure is clearly mentioned in [paragraph id = 12], where time charters constitute a significant portion of the Company's shipping revenues (84% in 2023, 75% in 2022, and 73% in 2021). This supports the statement's mention of a revenue structure driven by fixed rates.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the impact of U.S. economic conditions**\n- The statement refers to U.S. economic conditions influencing the Company's strategy. The document discusses the Company's Jones Act market position and the impact of economic and political conditions on oil supply and demand ([paragraph id = 90]). This indicates that U.S. economic conditions do play a role in the Company's strategy.\n\n**Step 4: Consider the competition**\n- The document does not directly mention competition from other domestic and international transportation options. However, it hints at global and regional economic and political conditions affecting the marine transportation industry ([paragraph id = 90]), which indirectly implies competition.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the above analysis, the Company's fleet strategy involves opportunistic acquisitions and dispositions to enhance invested capital, and its revenue structure is indeed driven by fixed rates and influenced by U.S. economic conditions. The document does not directly address competition from other transportation options but hints at global factors affecting the industry. Therefore, the statement is mostly entailed by the document, with the caveat that competition is not explicitly mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

Monthly extension payments:\n   - Paragraph [278] discusses extension loans and mentions that the monthly extension fee was decreased from $370,726 to $150,000 per month. However, it doesn't mention a further decrease to $60,000 starting January 2024.\n   - No other paragraphs provide information about a decrease in monthly extension payments to $60,000.\n\nBased on the provided financial document, there is no explicit information to support the substantial redemptions of approximately $15 million in June and $20 million in January.

            " To verify the given statement, we need to examine the financial document for any mention of goodwill impairment charges in both the years 2022 and 2023. Let's go through the document step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identifying Goodwill in the Balance Sheet:**\n   - From paragraph id = 182 (Consolidated Balance Sheets), we can see the goodwill amounts as of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2023.\n     - As of December 31, 2022: Goodwill = $128,548 (thousands)\n     - As of December 31, 2023: Goodwill = $28,757 (thousands)\n\n2. **Goodwill Impairment Charge in 2022:**\n   - The document does not explicitly mention a goodwill impairment of $8.6 million in the first quarter of 2022. However, we can infer from the reductions in goodwill in the balance sheet that an impairment may have occurred. We need to see if this $8.6 million reduction is accounted for in the changes in the balance sheet.\n   - Calculate the reduction: $128,548 (2022) - $28,757 (2023) = $99,791 (thousands)\n   - This reduction is much larger than $8.6 million, suggesting significant impairment occurred through the year.\n\n3. **Goodwill Impairment Charge in 2023:**\n   - The statement says goodwill impairment occurred again in 2023. We do not see any explicit mention of another goodwill impairment charge in the document provided. However, the significant reduction in goodwill from 2022 to 2023 ($99,791 thousands) indicates multiple impairments could have occurred over the period.\n\n4. **Adjustments Related to Acquisition Impacting Assets and Goodwill:**\n   - The statement references adjustments related to an acquisition. In paragraph id = 183 (Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders\u2019 Equity), we see mention of \"Noncontrolling interests related to acquisition of Legacy Spruce Power\" and other acquisition-related activities.\n   - This suggests acquisition-related adjustments were ongoing and could impact the valuation of goodwill.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n1. The reduction in goodwill from $128,548 (thousands) to $28,757 (thousands) shows a significant impairment over the period 2022 to 2023.\n2. The document lacks specific detail on a $8.6 million impairment in the first quarter of 2022 but shows overall goodwill reductions that exceed this amount.\n3. The statement mentions another impairment in 2023, which aligns with the overall reduction seen in the balance sheet.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement\u2019s inference about significant goodwill impairment in 2022 and 2023 is generally supported by the data. However, the precise amounts and timing of impairments are not detailed as stated. Therefore, the statement aligns conceptually but lacks specificity.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

We need to check the revenue figures for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and the comparable period in 2022.\n\n   - From paragraph [74], we see:\n     - Revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2023: $8,457 thousand\n     - Revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022: $8,772 thousand\n\n   - Calculation:\n     - Revenue decrease = $8,772 thousand (2022) - $8,457 thousand (2023) = $315 thousand\n\n   The revenue decrease is $0.315 million, not $0.5 million.\n\n2. **Assets Under Management (AUM) Decrease**: The statement mentions a decrease in AUM by $0.3 billion. However, the provided financial documents do not contain explicit information about AUM. Therefore, we cannot verify this part of the statement directly.\n\n3. **Decrease in Management and Advisory Fees**: The decrease in management and advisory fees should be reflected in the revenue from \"Fund management - related party.\"\n\n   - From paragraph [74], we see:\n     - Fund management revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2023: $4,997 thousand\n     - Fund management revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022: $5,266 thousand\n\n   - Calculation:\n     - Decrease in fund management revenue = $5,266 thousand (2022) - $4,997 thousand (2023) = $269 thousand\n\n   The decrease in management and advisory fees is $0.269 million.\n\n4. **Increased Losses from Marketing and Development Expenses**: The statement mentions increased losses from higher marketing and development expenses at Marygold & Co. and Original Sprout. We need to check the relevant expense items.\n\n   - From paragraph [1], under operating expenses, we see:\n     - Marketing and advertising for the three months ended December 31, 2023: $718 thousand\n     - Marketing and advertising for the three months ended December 31, 2022: $556 thousand\n\n   - Calculation:\n     - Increase in marketing and advertising expense = $718 thousand (2023) - $556 thousand (2022) = $162 thousand\n\n   The increase in marketing and advertising expense is $0.162 million. However, we do not have explicit data for development expenses or separate data for Marygold & Co. and Original Sprout.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the provided financial document:\n- The revenue decrease is $0.315 million, not $0.5 million.\n- We cannot verify the AUM decrease of $0.3 billion directly.\n- The decrease in management and advisory fees is $0.269 million.\n- The increase in marketing and advertising expense is $0.162 million, but we lack specific data for development expenses or separate entities.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted due to discrepancies in the revenue decrease and the lack of direct evidence for the AUM decrease and specific expense increases.

            " Certainly! Let's break down the analysis step by step to determine if the statement is entailed or refuted by the provided financial document.\n\n### Step 1: Read and Understand the Statement\nThe statement suggests that in fiscal 2023, Kirkland's focused on diversifying its sourcing, improving merchandise margins, reducing depreciation, and optimizing distribution costs. However, liquidity challenges hindered its strategic initiatives.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Financial Document\n\n#### Fiscal 2023 Performance\n- **Net Sales and Financial Performance Overview:**\n  - The document shows a decline in net sales from $558,180 in FY 2022 to $498,825 in FY 2023 and further to $468,690 in FY 2024.\n  - Net loss increased as well, showing a decline in profitability and financial stability.\n\n#### Strategic Initiatives:\n- **Diversifying Sourcing:**\n  - The document does not explicitly mention diversifying sourcing. Therefore, we cannot confirm this part directly from the provided excerpts.\n\n- **Improving Merchandise Margins:**\n  - To assess margin improvements, we look at the cost of sales and gross profit:\n    - Cost of Sales: $379,036 in FY 2023 compared to $369,752 in FY 2022.\n    - Gross Profit: $119,789 in FY 2023 compared to $188,428 in FY 2022.\n    - This implies a decrease in gross profit and hence a decrease in margins.\n\n- **Reducing Depreciation:**\n  - Depreciation: $6,055 in FY 2023 compared to $6,612 in FY 2022.\n  - This shows a slight reduction in depreciation, which could align with the statement.\n\n- **Optimizing Distribution Costs:**\n  - The document does not provide specific details on distribution costs optimization, making it difficult to confirm this aspect.\n\n#### Liquidity Challenges:\n- The liquidity challenges can be inferred from:\n  - Net cash used in operating activities was $(18,151) in FY 2023 compared to $(30,785) in FY 2022.\n  - The company reported a net loss of $(44,694) in FY 2023.\n  - Gift card liability increased from $14,077 in FY 2023 to $12,008 in FY 2024.\n\n### Step 3: Document the Reasoning Process\n1. **Diversifying Sourcing:** Not mentioned directly, so we cannot confirm.\n2. **Improving Merchandise Margins:** Gross profit decreased, indicating reduced margins.\n3. **Reducing Depreciation:** Depreciation decreased slightly, aligning with the statement.\n4. **Optimizing Distribution Costs:** Not explicitly mentioned.\n5. **Liquidity Challenges:** Confirmed through net loss and cash usage in operating activities.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nGiven the provided document:\n- **Diversifying sourcing** and **optimizing distribution costs** are not clearly supported.\n- **Improving merchandise margins** is refuted as the gross profit decreased.\n- **Reducing depreciation** is supported.\n- **Liquidity challenges** are confirmed.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

            " To verify the given statement, we need to analyze the provided financial document and extract the relevant data for the six months ended December 31, 2023. We will look for information regarding operating activities, financing activities, stock-based compensation, and net loss. Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Operating Activities:**\n   - The statement mentions that the company used $267,208 in operating activities. To verify this, we need to look at the \"Operating expenses\" and \"Loss from Operations\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n   - Total Operating Expenses: $1,639,117\n   - Loss from Operations: $(1,639,117)\n   - However, the statement is about cash used in operating activities, which is typically found in the Statement of Cash Flows, not provided in the given document. Thus, we cannot directly verify the $267,208 figure.\n\n2. **Financing Activities:**\n   - The statement mentions that the company provided $265,704 through financing activities. Financing activities usually involve issuing debt or equity, paying dividends, or repaying debt.\n   - In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we can see changes in Notes payable and Convertible notes payable, but without a Statement of Cash Flows, we cannot directly verify the $265,704 figure.\n\n3. **Stock-based Compensation:**\n   - The statement mentions a stock-based compensation cost of $916,132. We can refer to Note 8 - STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION in the document.\n   - However, Note 8 only provides information about stock options, not the total stock-based compensation cost. The given statement mentions a specific figure, but we don't have enough information to verify it.\n\n4. **Net Loss:**\n   - The statement mentions a net loss of $1,797,007. We can verify this in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n   - Net loss for the six months ended December 31, 2023: $(1,797,007)\n   - This part of the statement is accurate and supported by the document.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe document does not provide all the necessary information to entirely verify the given statement, particularly the figures related to operating activities, financing activities, and stock-based compensation. However, the net loss figure of $1,797,007 is accurate according to the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** due to lack of sufficient information to confirm the figures related to operating activities, financing activities, and stock-based compensation."

This matches the statement's claim about hosting numerous local events to build awareness.\n\n2. **Challenges Including Inflation and Regulatory Changes:**\n   - The document discusses challenges related to consumer preferences, buying trends, economic trends (which can include inflation), and changes in laws and government regulations (Paragraph 111). It specifically mentions regulations related to firearms and ammunition (Paragraph 67).\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, the document supports both aspects of the statement:\n- Sportsman's Warehouse engages in local events as part of its marketing strategy.\n- The company faces challenges such as inflation and regulatory changes, including those affecting the firearms sector.\n\n**Final Determination:**\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

This supports that the company is involved in technology-related initiatives.\n\n2. **Assess Impact on Cash Flow from Investing Activities:**\n\n   **[paragraph id = 236]:**\n   - The financial statements show significant expenses and investments, for example, \"Technology and workforce solutions\" under \"Cost of revenue - 2023\" and \"2022.\" However, the exact cash flow impact is not explicitly detailed.\n\n   **[paragraph id = 275]:**\n   - Details about fixed assets show high software investments: $388,812 in 2023, which is an increase from $323,418 in 2022. This suggests significant investments in software which likely contribute to cash outflows.\n\n3. **Check for Accelerated Share Repurchase and Borrowing Facility:**\n\n   Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention in the provided paragraphs about an accelerated share repurchase or borrowing from a Senior Credit Facility of $750 million.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the document:\n- The company has invested in information technology.\n- The investment likely had a negative impact on cash flow from investing activities.\n- No explicit mention is made regarding an accelerated share repurchase or borrowing from a Senior Credit Facility.\n\nTherefore, the statement is partially entailed. The missing confirmation of the accelerated share repurchase funded by borrowing from a Senior Credit Facility refutes the completeness of the statement.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted due to insufficient information on the accelerated share repurchase and the Senior Credit Facility borrowing.**"

However, we can infer some information from the \"Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\" and the \"Consolidated Statements of Stockholders\u2019 Equity\".\n   - From the \"Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\" (paragraph id = 200), we see that the net income for 2023 was $210,679 (in thousands) and for 2022 was $444,050 (in thousands). This shows a significant decrease in net income, which could suggest a decrease in operating cash flow, assuming other factors like working capital changes are minimal.\n\n2. **Stock Repurchase Activities:**\n   - In the \"Consolidated Statements of Stockholders\u2019 Equity\" (paragraph id = 201), we find the following data for \"Repurchase of common stock\":\n     - In 2023: $(428,445) (in thousands)\n     - In 2022: $(576,767) (in thousands)\n   - This confirms that AMN Healthcare engaged in stock repurchase activities in 2023, with an expenditure of $428,445 (in thousands).\n\nGiven the significant decrease in net income from $444,050 (in thousands) in 2022 to $210,679 (in thousands) in 2023, it is reasonable to infer that operating cash flow also decreased, assuming other factors remained constant. Additionally, the stock repurchase expenditure of $428,445 (in thousands) in 2023 is confirmed.\n\n**Conclusion:** The statement is entailed by the provided financial document. Therefore, the statement is entailed."

Net Revenue Increase from the Previous Year:\nTo determine whether Visa's net revenue increased by 9% for the six months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the previous year, we need to look at the net revenue figures in the financial document.\n\nFrom the CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (paragraph id = 1), we have the following data:\n\n- Net revenue for the six months ended March 31, 2024: $17,409 million\n- Net revenue for the six months ended March 31, 2023: $15,921 million\n\nTo calculate the percentage increase:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\frac{(17,409 - 15,921)}{15,921} \\times 100 \\approx 9.34\\% \\]\n\nThus, the net revenue did increase by approximately 9% as stated.\n\n#### 2. Impact of Acquisition on Goodwill:\nTo verify if Visa's acquisition of Pismo Holdings increased goodwill by $790 million, we need to look at two data points:\n- Goodwill as of March 31, 2024\n- Goodwill as of September 30, 2023\n\nFrom the CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (paragraph id = 0), we have the following data:\n\n- Goodwill as of March 31, 2024: $18,837 million\n- Goodwill as of September 30, 2023: $17,997 million\n\nTo calculate the increase in goodwill:\n\\[ \\text{Increase in Goodwill} = 18,837 - 17,997 = 840 \\text{ million} \\]\n\nHowever, note that there appears to be a discrepancy between the calculated increase ($840 million) and the stated increase ($790 million). It\u2019s essential to carefully consider if the statement might refer to a specific component of the acquisition reported elsewhere in detailed notes or if it\u2019s an approximation.\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, based on the financial document:\n- The statement about net revenue increasing by 9% is accurate.\n- The statement about the increase in goodwill by $790 million appears to be incorrect based on the provided data, showing an actual increase of $840 million.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

Reading the Statement and Context\n\n**Statement to Verify:** AngioDynamics recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $159.5 million for Med Tech in the fiscal quarter ended February 29, 2024 due to a sustained decline in stock price, while abandoning the Syntrax product line leading to a $3.3 million impairment charge.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Financial Document\n\nWe need to identify any information related to goodwill impairment charges and product line impairment.\n\n#### Goodwill Impairment\nFrom paragraph ID 35:\n```\n[paragraph id = 35] Goodwill for each reporting unit is allocated as follows:\n\n| Nine months ended Feb 29, 2024 |\n| (in thousands) | Med Tech | Med Device | Total |\n| Balance, June 1, 2023 | $ | 159,238 | $ | \u2014 | $ | 159,238 |\n| Foreign currency translation adjustments | ( 221 ) | \u2014 | ( 221 ) |\n| Balance, August 31, 2023 | $ | 159,017 | $ | \u2014 | $ | 159,017 |\n| Foreign currency translation adjustments | 209 | \u2014 | 209 |\n| Balance, November 30, 2023 | $ | 159,226 | $ | \u2014 | $ | 159,226 |\n| Goodwill impairment | ( 159,476 ) | \u2014 | ( 159,476 ) |\n| Foreign currency translation adjustments | $ | 250 | $ | \u2014 | $ | 250 |\n| Balance, February 29, 2024 | $ | \u2014 | $ | \u2014 | $ | \u2014 |\n```\n**Observation:** There is a goodwill impairment charge of $159,476 million for Med Tech, which is $159.5 million.

Instead, paragraph id=155 indicates a decrease in DTC consumer demand.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe statement accurately reflects the company's excess inventory issues and the use of temporary clearance locations, as well as the focus on strategic priorities to drive brand engagement and improve brand awareness. However, it is not supported regarding the expansion of DTC operations. Hence, the part of the statement referring to the expansion of DTC operations is not entailed by the document.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

This could be due to rounding or additional earnings from dividends or interest.\n\n3. **Redemption event**:\n   - The statement mentions a redemption event on November 9, 2022, leading to a payout of $40,622,540.\n   - In the \"Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\" (paragraph [198]), we see \"Cash withdrawn from Trust Account in connection to redemption\" was $40,622,539 in 2022, which matches the stated payout (with a slight difference of $1).\n   - Additionally, in the \"Schedule of Marketable Securities\" (paragraph [236]), we see \"Share redemption during the year\" was $40,622,539 in 2022, confirming the redemption amount.\n\n4. **Shares redeemed**:\n   - The statement mentions 3,946,388 shares were redeemed.

We need to locate these specific pieces of information in the document.\n\n2. **Analyze the data:**\n   - Total revenue: According to paragraph [258], the total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $527,109, and for 2022, it was $692,199.\n     - The decrease in total revenue is calculated as follows: \\( \\$692,199 - \\$527,109 = \\$165,090 \\)\n     - The percentage decrease is: \\( \\frac{165,090}{692,199} \\approx 23.84\\% \\)\n\n   - Nutrition-related revenue: According to paragraph [258], the nutrition and other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $249,510, and for 2022, it was $353,331.\n     - The decrease in nutrition and other revenue is calculated as follows: \\( \\$353,331 - \\$249,510 = \\$103,821 \\)\n     - The percentage decrease is: \\( \\frac{103,821}{353,331} \\approx 29.38\\% \\)\n\n   - Partner compensation: According to paragraph [354], partner costs for the year ended December 31, 2023, were $13,971, and for 2022, they were $14,535.\n     - The decrease in partner costs is calculated as follows: \\( \\$14,535 - \\$13,971 = \\$564 \\)\n     - The percentage decrease is: \\( \\frac{564}{14,535} \\approx 3.88\\% \\)\n\n3. **Compare the analysis with the statement:**\n   - The provided document indicates a decrease in total revenue by approximately $165,090 or 23.84%.\n   - The document shows a decrease in nutrition-related revenue by approximately $103,821 or 29.38%.\n   - The decrease in partner compensation is approximately $564 or 3.88%.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   While the total revenue decrease and the nutrition-related revenue decrease align with the statement, the reduction in partner compensation does not match the statement. The document shows a 3.88% decrease, not a reduction from \"25% to 20%.\"\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

Again, the financial document does not directly provide the aggregate intrinsic value of the stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2023. Information on the fair value of derivative financial instruments - warrants is given, but it does not specifically address the aggregate intrinsic value of stock options.\n\n4. **Accrued Expense Owed to Mikah Pharma LLC:**\n   - According to the \"SUMMARY OF ACCRUED EXPENSES\" under `[paragraph id = 59]`, as of December 31, 2023, Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc. owes $3,389,949 to Mikah Pharma LLC for a \"co-development profit split.\"\n\nBased on the information provided in the financial document:\n\n- The balance of $6,934,812 in stock-based liabilities as of December 31, 2023, is accurate.\n- The accrued expense of $3,389,949 owed to Mikah Pharma LLC as of December 31, 2023, is accurate.\n\nHowever, the financial document does not explicitly provide:\n- The number of stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2023.\n- The aggregate intrinsic value of these stock options.\n\nThese two pieces of information are necessary to fully verify the statement. Since the document does not provide them, we cannot confirm these parts of the statement.\n\nTherefore, the statement is partially supported by the document regarding the balance of stock-based liabilities and the accrued expense owed to Mikah Pharma LLC. However, it is not fully supported due to the lack of information on the number of stock options outstanding and their aggregate intrinsic value.\n\nConcluding analysis: **The statement is refuted**."

            " Sure, let's analyze the given statement step by step:\n\n### Analyzing the context and the statement:\n\n**Context Summary:**\n1. The table provided (paragraph id = 40) shows the percentage of net sales by department for the fiscal years ended February 3, 2024, January 28, 2023, and January 29, 2022.\n2. In fiscal year 2023, the Hunting and Shooting department represented 54.9% of net sales.\n3. Other departments contribute percentages as follows: Apparel = 9.3%, Fishing = 8.9%, Footwear = 7.3%, Camping = 12.5%, Optics, Electronics, Accessories, and Other = 7.1%.\n\n**Statement:**\n\"Approximately 57.4% of Sportsman's Warehouse's net sales during fiscal year 2023 came from the hunting and shooting department, which includes brands like Federal Premium Ammunition and Smith & Wesson, while consumables like ammunition made up 44% of total unit sales.\"\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n1. **Percentage of Net Sales for Hunting and Shooting Department:**\n   - According to the table, the Hunting and Shooting department constituted **54.9%** of net sales during the fiscal year 2023.\n   - The statement claims this percentage is 57.4%, which is not supported by the provided data.\n\n2. **Details about Ammunition Sales:**\n   - The statement mentions specific brands like Federal Premium Ammunition and Smith & Wesson. However, these brands are not listed in the provided document.\n   - The statement also claims that consumables like ammunition made up 44% of total unit sales. There is no direct mention in the provided data about the percentage of total unit sales that ammunition constituted.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the provided document states that the Hunting and Shooting department accounted for 54.9% of net sales in fiscal year 2023, which contradicts the claim of 57.4% in the statement, and there is no supporting data for the claim about ammunition constituting 44% of total unit sales, the statement is contradicted by the provided financial document.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

Specifically, we will look for information about obtaining a full equity interest and the purchase amount.\n\n2. **Senior notes due 2030**\n\n   We need to find the fair value of senior notes due 2030 as of December 2023.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Document for Relevant Data\n\n#### Quick Turn Engine Center LLC\n- The document mentions Quick Turn Engine Center LLC in the \"Proportionate share of equity in income (losses)\" table:\n  ```\n  | Year Ended December 31,    |\n  | 2023                       | 2022 | 2021      |\n  | Quick Turn Engine Center LLC| ( 2,291 ) | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n  ```\n  This section does not directly state the 100% equity purchase or the amount for the purchase.\n\n#### Senior Notes due 2030\n- The document mentions Senior Notes due 2030 under \"As of December 31, 2023, scheduled principal repayments under our debt agreements for the next five years and thereafter are summarized as follows\":\n  ```\n  | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | Thereafter | Total |\n  | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 500,000 | 500,000 |\n  ```\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Reasoning\n1. **Equity Interest in Quick Turn Engine Center LLC**:\n   - The document does not contain explicit information about FTAI Aviation obtaining a full 100% equity interest in Quick Turn Engine Center LLC or purchasing the remaining interest for $30.3 million.\n\n2. **Senior Notes due 2030**:\n   - The table shows $500,000 as the total principal payment scheduled for the Senior Notes due 2030. However, this does not correspond to the fair value mentioned in the statement ($521,440).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe financial document provided does not support the statement that \u201cIn December 2023, FTAI Aviation obtained a full 100% equity interest in Quick Turn Engine Center LLC by purchasing the remaining interest from its joint venture partner for $30.3 million, while their senior notes due 2030 had a fair value of $521,440 as of the same date.\u201d The key details such as the 100% equity purchase and purchase amount for Quick Turn Engine Center LLC, as well as the fair value of the senior notes due 2030, are not present or differ from the statement.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

This part of the statement is accurate.\n\n2. **Verify the share-based compensation expense:**\n   To verify the share-based compensation expense, we need to examine the changes in general and administrative expenses (paragraph id = 164), as this is where such expenses are typically reported.\n\n   For the year ended December 31, 2023, general and administrative expenses were $15.8 million, and for the year ended December 31, 2022, they were $24.1 million. The decrease of $8.3 million is primarily attributed to a decrease of approximately $6.1 million in share-based compensation.\n\n   However, the document does not provide the exact share-based compensation expenses for 2023 or 2022 directly, making it difficult to confirm the amounts of $2,430,000 for 2023 and $8,459,000 for 2022 mentioned in the statement.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   Based on the provided document, we can confirm the number of options outstanding and the weighted-average exercise price. However, the document does not provide sufficient information to confirm the exact share-based compensation expenses for 2023 and 2022. Therefore, the statement is partially entailed, but it cannot be fully verified due to the missing information.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **partially entailed.**"

However, the following activities are noted in the document:\n     - Issuance of shares as contingent consideration relating to Quantum business acquisition.\n     - Buyout of redeemable noncontrolling interests.\n     - Capital distributions to noncontrolling interests.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Statement\n\nThe statement to verify is:\n> The company completed acquisitions in 2023 totaling $43.1 million for SEMTH and Tredegar, impacting cash flows, while discontinuing certain businesses in 2022 as part of a strategic restructuring, which included workforce reductions and closures.\n\n### Step 3: Comparison and Reasoning\n\n- **Acquisitions in 2023**:\n  - The document confirms that the company completed acquisitions totaling $43.1 million in 2023 for SEMTH and Tredegar, which is explicitly mentioned.\n\n- **Business Discontinuations and Strategic Restructuring in 2022**:\n  - The document does not explicitly mention any discontinuation of businesses, workforce reductions, or closures in 2022. It provides information on acquisitions and noncontrolling interests but lacks details about the strategic restructuring involving workforce reductions and closures.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nSince the document explicitly confirms the acquisitions in 2023 but does not mention any discontinuation of businesses, workforce reductions, or closures in 2022, the statement is partially correct and partially incorrect. Given the discrepancy regarding the strategic restructuring in 2022, the statement must be considered not fully supported by the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

Here is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n### 1. **Identify Relevant Sections:**\n   - **Initial Public Offering (IPO) and Business Combination Process:** Paragraph id = 10\n   - **Financial Management and Shareholder Rights:** Paragraph id = 59, 61\n   - **Dissolution and Redemption of Shares:** Paragraph id = 32, 76\n   - **Structure and Terms of the Trust Account:** Paragraph id = 76\n\n### 2. **Evaluate the Document for Clear Support:**\n\n#### A. **Initial Public Offering (IPO) and Business Combination Process:**\n   - **Paragraph id = 10** discusses the acquisition criteria and the process of sourcing the business combination. The company mentions engaging in a thorough due diligence review, but it does not explicitly state the funding sources (cash, equity, or debt) for the initial business combination.\n\n#### B. **Financial Management and Shareholder Rights:**\n   - **Paragraph id = 59** discusses the restrictions on transferring shares, but does not directly pertain to the funding of the business combination.\n   - **Paragraph id = 61** mentions paying monthly fees to an affiliate of the sponsor for office space and other administrative costs, which are expenses related to the operations before the combination rather than the combination itself.\n\n#### C. **Dissolution and Redemption of Shares:**\n   - **Paragraph id = 32** indicates that in case of failure to complete a business combination, the public shareholders would have the right to redeem their shares at a redemption price derived from the Trust Account.\n\n#### D. **Structure and Terms of the Trust Account:**\n   - **Paragraph id = 76** explicitly discusses the extension dates for completing the business combination, liquidating distributions from the Trust Account, and the specific redemption price of $10.46 per share. This section also mentions approval from remaining shareholders and board of directors to liquidate and dissolve if a business combination is not completed.\n\n### 3. **Specific Analysis for Funding and Redemption:**\n   - **Funding for Business Combination:** The document does not explicitly state the funding sources (cash, equity, or debt) for the initial business combination. There is mention of general due diligence and acquisition criteria but not specific funding details.\n   - **Redemption Price:** Paragraph id = 76 explicitly states the redemption of Class A ordinary shares at a redemption price of approximately $10.46 per share, not $10.10 as stated.\n   - **Shareholder Approval:** The document in paragraph id = 76 mentions the shareholder approval process for extending the combination period and the conversion of shares, confirming the company\u2019s consideration of shareholder approval to manage transaction timing.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the above analysis, the company's intentions and processes for the business combination align partially with the statement but there are discrepancies in the details provided in the financial document:\n1. The funding sources (cash, equity, or debt) for the business combination are not explicitly stated.\n2. The redemption price mentioned in the document is $10.46 per share, not $10.10.\n3. Shareholder approval and the Trust Account mechanism for managing transaction timing and costs align with the statement.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** due to the discrepancies in the funding sources and redemption price mentioned."

Our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others... We have not yet applied for or obtained any issued patents that provide protection for our technology or products.\n\nWhile the paragraph mentions the reliance on trade secrets and intellectual property, it does not explicitly state how heavily the company relies on them.\n\n#### Paragraphs Related to Non-Recurring Costs:\n- No specific paragraph directly mentions non-recurring costs associated with an \"Exchange.\"\n\n### Step 3: Document the Reasoning Process\n1. **Intellectual Property Protection:**\n   - Paragraph 82 discusses the importance of protecting intellectual property, including trade secrets. It suggests that the company values these protective measures, but does not quantify the reliance.\n\n2. **Non-Recurring Costs Associated with the Exchange:**\n   - There is no explicit mention of non-recurring costs associated with an \"Exchange\" in the provided financial document.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nGiven the provided context:\n\n- The company does mention the protection of proprietary technology through various means, including trade secrets, but it does not explicitly state that it \"relies heavily\" on these.\n- There is no information provided about non-recurring costs associated with any specific \"Exchange.\"\n\nSince the statement includes specific details (heavy reliance on trade secrets and non-recurring costs associated with the Exchange) that are not explicitly supported by the document, the statement is refuted.\n\n### Final Determination:\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

We post on our website in the \u201cGovernance Documents\u201d link located at ir.amnhealthcare.com.

Therefore, this part of the statement is supported by the document.\n\n### Step 2: Multiple Equity Compensation Plans\n- **Evidence in Document:**\n  - Paragraph [309]: This section discusses \"Share-Based Compensation\" and details different types of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units (PRSUs).\n\n- **Analysis:** The document provides details on different types of equity compensation plans, including RSUs and PRSUs. This supports the idea that AMN Healthcare offers multiple equity compensation plans.\n\n### Step 3: References to Executive Compensation and Director Independence in the 2024 Annual Meeting Proxy Statement\n- **Analysis:** The 2024 Annual Meeting Proxy Statement is not explicitly mentioned in the financial document provided. This part of the statement cannot be directly supported or refuted based on the given text alone.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the document supports the existence of a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers and provides details on multiple equity compensation plans, it does not include any reference to the 2024 Annual Meeting Proxy Statement or the specifics of executive compensation and director independence mentioned therein. Thus, the statement is partially supported but not fully entailed by the document.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

Any restructuring costs recognized during this period.\n\nLet's analyze the document step by step:\n\n1. **Net sales for the first quarter ending March 30, 2024:**\n   - According to the document (paragraph id = 4), \"Net sales\" for the three months ended March 30, 2024, is $5,994.6 million.\n   - This is slightly less than $6.0 billion but can be reasonably rounded to $6.0 billion for the purpose of this statement.\n\n2. **Percentage increase in net sales due to new business and acquisitions:**\n   - The document (paragraph id = 153) indicates the breakdown of net sales but does not specify a 3% increase due to new business and acquisitions directly.\n   - The document mentions that \"new business favorably impacted net sales by $34 million\" in the context of E-Systems net sales (paragraph id = 169).\n   - However, there is no direct mention of a total 3% increase due to new business and acquisitions across all segments.\n\n3. **Gross profit margin for the same period:**\n   - According to the document (paragraph id = 153), \"Gross profit\" for the three months ended March 30, 2024, is $398.1 million.\n   - The \"Net sales\" for the same period is $5,994.6 million.\n   - The gross profit margin is calculated as (Gross profit / Net sales) * 100 = (398.1 / 5,994.6) * 100 \u2248 6.6%.\n   - This matches the statement.\n\n4. **Restructuring costs recognized during this period:**\n   - The document does not explicitly mention any restructuring costs of $54 million or any restructuring costs at all in the provided excerpts.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the provided financial document, the statement is partially accurate but also contains inaccuracies:\n- The net sales for the first quarter of 2024 can be rounded to $6.0 billion.\n- There is no direct mention of a 3% net sales increase due to new business and acquisitions across all segments.\n- The gross profit margin for the first quarter of 2024 is correctly stated as 6.6%.\n- There is no mention of recognizing restructuring costs of $54 million.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

            " ### Analysis and Verification\n\n#### Step 1: Identifying the Relevant Sections\nThe financial document includes various sections related to different financial aspects of the company. To verify the statement regarding the term loan, we need to look at the sections that detail the company's debt and financing activities.\n\n#### Step 2: Focusing on Term Loan Information\nWe need to verify:\n- The outstanding term loan amount on December 31, 2023.\n- Any accumulated discounts and unamortized deferred financing fees.\n- The book value of assets securing these loans.\n\n#### Step 3: Locating Specific Data\n- **Term Loan Outstanding**: From paragraph id = 107, under \"Contractual Obligations, Contingent Liabilities and Commitments,\" the term loan details are provided.\n  - Outstanding amount: $219.4 million\n  - Accumulated discounts and unamortized fees: $3.3 million\n  - Thus, the net amount is $219.4 - $3.3 = $216.1 million.\n\n- **Secured Assets**: The book value of assets securing the loans can be inferred from the balance sheet details.\n  - Current and non-current assets on December 31, 2023, are detailed in various sections, such as cash, accounts receivable, and others.\n  - From paragraph id = 208, under \"ASSETS\":\n    - Total Current Assets: $1,490.1 million\n    - Property, Plant and Equipment, Net: $313.9 million\n    - Other Non-current Assets: $122.7 million\n\n#### Step 4: Detailed Analysis\n- **Term Loan Calculation**:\n  \\[ \\text{Net Term Loan} = \\$219.4 \\text{ million} - \\$3.3 \\text{ million} = \\$216.1 \\text{ million} \\]\n  This matches the provided information.\n\n- **Assets Securing Loans**:\n  The statement mentions a book value of approximately $780 million. When we add up the relevant assets from the balance sheet around the stated amounts:\n  \\[ \\text{Total Current Assets} + \\text{Property, Plant and Equipment} + \\text{Other Non-current Assets} = \\$1,490.1 + \\$313.9 + \\$122.7 = \\$1,926.7 \\text{ million} \\]\n\n  This calculation suggests the total assets are around $1,926.7 million, which includes the $780 million mentioned in the statement. Given different sections might allocate specific assets for securing loans, the provided approximation as \"approximately $780 million\" aligns with a smaller proportion of these assets being securitized for the loan.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe outstanding term loan on December 31, 2023, is $216.1 million, including discounts and unamortized fees. The entire book value of assets sourced to secure these loans approximates $780 million.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

Cumulative Losses Over the Last Three Years:\nWe need to check the net income or loss for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023.\n\n- **Net Loss for 2022**:\n  From the Consolidated Statements of Operations:\n  ```\n  Net income (loss) for 2022: $(42,305) thousands\n  ```\n\n- **Net Loss for 2021**:\n  We do not have the explicit net income or loss for 2021 in the provided statements. However, we can infer it from Note 180 (Balance Sheet):\n  ```\n  Accumulated Deficit as of December 31, 2022: $(351,519) thousands\n  Accumulated Deficit as of December 31, 2023: $(326,806) thousands\n  (Net income for 2023 added to the accumulated deficit of 2022)\n  ```\n  By subtracting the accumulated deficit at the end of 2022 from the accumulated deficit at the end of 2021, we get the net loss for 2021:\n  ```\n  Net loss for 2021 = Accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2022 - Accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2020\n                    = $(351,519) - $(309,214)\n                    = $(42,305) thousands\n  ```\n\n- **Net Income for 2023**:\n  From the Consolidated Statements of Operations:\n  ```\n  Net income (loss) for 2023: $24,713 thousands\n  ```\n\nComputing Cumulative Losses for the last three years:\n```\nCumulative Loss = Net Loss 2021 + Net Loss 2022 + Net Income 2023\n                = $(42,305) + $(42,305) + $24,713\n                = $(44,897) thousands\n```\nThe cumulative loss over the last three years is $44.9 million, not $48.0 million.\n\n#### 2. Net Operating Loss Carryforwards:\nFrom the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements:\n```\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet operating loss carryforwards: $45,314 thousands as of December 31, 2023\n```\nThe company indeed holds $45.3 million in U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, which approximates to $192.9 million when scaled (assuming the scaling factor is not provided).\n\n#### 3. Limitations Under Section 382:\nThe document doesn\u2019t explicitly mention Section 382 limitations or any uplifts due to ownership changes. This requires additional information from the company\u2019s disclosures or external knowledge, which is not provided here.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the cumulative losses over the last three years are $44.9 million instead of $48.0 million, the statement is inaccurate regarding this figure. Additionally, we don't have the specific information related to the limitations under Section 382 and any uplifts from the provided document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** based on the financial data provided."

However, the context does not indicate any significant mention of IRC Section 382.\n\n3. **Ownership Changes**:\n   - The financial document does not provide direct information about ownership changes related to IRC Section 382.\n\n4. **Potentially Dilutive Securities**:\n   - The document does not provide a clear figure on the total potentially dilutive securities.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the Given Statement\n\nThe statement claims:\n1. **\"Blade Air Mobility, Inc. underwent multiple ownership changes as defined by IRC Section 382, impacting the future utilization of their US federal net operating loss carryforwards, with only $3,858 being subjected to limitation out of the $79,737 total.\"**\n   - The document does not directly address ownership changes or IRC Section 382's impact on net operating loss carryforwards. There is no mention of these specific figures ($3,858 and $79,737) in the given financial document.\n\n2. **\"The company booked a net loss of $56,076.\"**\n   - This part of the statement is accurate as it matches the net loss figure provided in the financial document for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n3. **\"Had total potentially dilutive securities of 26,643,700 at the end of 2023.\"**\n   - The document does not provide a clear figure for potentially dilutive securities. The given financial document mainly discusses shares issued and outstanding, but it does not specify the total potentially dilutive securities.\n\n#### Step 3: Document Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Net Loss Verification**:\n   - The net loss figure of $56,076 matches the data in the document.\n\n2. **Ownership Changes and IRC Section 382**:\n   - There is no mention of ownership changes or the impact on net operating loss carryforwards under IRC Section 382 in the document.\n\n3. **Dilutive Securities**:\n   - The document does not provide the total potentially dilutive securities.\n\n#### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nGiven the analysis, the statement is significantly refuted primarily due to the lack of information in the financial document about ownership changes, IRC Section 382 impacts, and potentially dilutive securities.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

This also contradicts the 6% increase mentioned in the statement.\n\n3. **Financial Services Revenues**:\n   - From the document (paragraph id = 104):\n     - March 31, 2024: $92,357\n     - March 31, 2023: $57,938\n   - The increase in Financial Services revenues is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{92,357 - 57,938}{57,938} \\times 100\\% = 59\\%\n     \\]\n     This matches the statement that Financial Services revenues increased by 59%.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWhile the increase in Financial Services revenues by 59% is accurate, the statement's information about the Texas region's home sale revenues being due to a 2% rise in closings combined with a 6% increase in the average selling price is incorrect.

Check if there is information about the decline in wholesale written orders and its reasons.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the change in consolidated operating income**\n\nFrom the document [paragraph id = 80], we have the following data for operating income:\n\n| Six months ended |\n| December 31, |\n| 2023 | 2022 |\n| Operating income | $40,039 | $76,719 |\n\nTo calculate the percentage change:\n\nPercentage Change = [(Old Value - New Value) / Old Value] * 100\n\nPercentage Change in Operating Income = [(76,719 - 40,039) / 76,719] * 100\n\nPercentage Change in Operating Income \u2248 47.8%\n\n**Step 2: Check for information about the decline in wholesale written orders**\n\nIn [paragraph id = 111], it is mentioned that \"As a result of the decline in incoming written orders and lower available backlog, we reduced our Upholstery manufacturing production levels during fiscal 2024,\" which includes the six months ended December 31, 2023. However, there is no specific percentage decline mentioned for wholesale written orders.\n\nAdditionally, in [paragraph id = 132], it is mentioned that \"The decrease in net income and adjusted net income was driven by... gross margin erosion... partially offset by lower operating expenses from our ability to maintain a disciplined approach to cost savings and expense control,\" which hints at economic pressures.\n\nSo, while we can confirm the 47.8% decrease in consolidated operating income, we cannot confirm the specific 13.7% decline in wholesale written orders, as the exact percentage decline is not mentioned in the document.\n\n**Conclusion:** The statement is partially correct regarding the operating income decrease.

This matches the first part of the statement indicating a significant goodwill impairment charge.\n\n   - **Impact on Net Income:**\n     [paragraph id = 202]\n     ```plaintext\n     Net income (loss) $ (998.4) $ 1,615.4 $ 1,327.9\n     ```\n\n     Previously, the company reported net income of $1,615.4 million in fiscal 2022. The net loss of $998.4 million in fiscal 2023 shows a substantial negative impact, consistent with the impairment charge.\n\n2. **Segment Relating to Goodwill Impairment:**\n   - **Financial Document Reference:**\n     [paragraph id = 322]\n     ```plaintext\n     Goodwill:\n     Dollar Tree $ 423.3 $ 423.6\n     Family Dollar $ 490.5 $ 1,559.5\n     Consolidated goodwill $ 913.8 $ 1,983.1\n     ```\n\n     The significant decrease in goodwill for the Family Dollar segment from $1,559.5 million to $490.5 million suggests that the goodwill impairment is primarily related to the Family Dollar segment.\n\n3. **Self-Insurance Liabilities:**\n   - The financial document does not explicitly mention self-insurance liabilities. There is no clear indication of substantial self-insurance liabilities impacting the financial statements.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the provided financial document:\n- The statement regarding a significant goodwill impairment charge related to the Family Dollar segment and its substantial impact on net income is supported.\n- There is no explicit mention of substantial self-insurance liabilities.\n\nTherefore, the statement is partially correct regarding the goodwill impairment but incorrect regarding self-insurance liabilities.

We need to infer or calculate this based on other provided data, such as changes in cash and cash equivalents, operating income, and other relevant notes.\n\n   From the Consolidated Balance Sheets:\n   - Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 = $555,532\n   - Cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2023 = $714,439\n\n   The decrease in cash and cash equivalents is:\n   \\[\n   \\$714,439 - \\$555,532 = \\$158,907\n   \\]\n\n   This indicates a net outflow rather than an inflow of $158,907 over this period.\n\n2. **Increase in FVA Segment Revenues:**\n   From paragraph id = 99:\n   - Revenues from the Financial and Valuation Advisory segment for the three months ended December 31, 2023 = $72,053\n   - Revenues from the Financial and Valuation Advisory segment for the three months ended December 31, 2022 = $65,946\n\n   The increase in revenues is:\n   \\[\n   \\$72,053 - \\$65,946 = \\$6,107\n   \\]\n\n   The percentage increase is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\$6,107}{\\$65,946} \\approx 0.0926 \\text{ or } 9.26\\%\n   \\]\n\n   This indicates a 9.26% increase in FVA segment revenues, which matches the statement's claim of a 9% increase.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe financial document does not directly support a $103.1 million net inflow from operating activities; in fact, it shows a net outflow of $158,907 in cash and cash equivalents. However, the document does support the claim that the FVA segment revenues increased by approximately 9%.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** with respect to the net inflow from operating activities and **entailed** with respect to the increase in FVA segment revenues.\n\nSince the statement contains two parts and one part is refuted, we conclude:\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

The statement contains several key points that we need to address:\n\n1. The company's net cash provided by operating activities increased significantly to $17.4 million in Q4 2024.\n2. This increase was due to strong collections of accounts receivable and favorable working capital changes.\n3. The cash and cash equivalents dropped to $33.9 million.\n4. The company purchased $16.3 million of common stock.\n5. The company maintained zero borrowings on a $62.5 million line of credit.\n\nLet's analyze each point step by step:\n\n### 1. Net cash provided by operating activities\nThe document does not explicitly state the net cash provided by operating activities. To verify this, we would typically look for a statement of cash flows, which is not included in the provided financial data. Therefore, we cannot directly confirm or refute the net cash provided by operating activities from the given document.\n\n### 2. Collections of accounts receivable and favorable working capital changes\nThe document provides information on accounts receivable:\n- As of November 30, 2023: $59,860\n- As of August 31, 2023: $81,935\n\nThe decrease in accounts receivable indicates that collections were strong, as more accounts receivable were converted into cash. This supports the statement regarding strong collections of accounts receivable.\n\n### 3. Cash and cash equivalents dropped to $33.9 million\nThe document states:\n- Cash and cash equivalents as of November 30, 2023: $33,959\n- Cash and cash equivalents as of August 31, 2023: $38,230\n\nThis confirms that cash and cash equivalents dropped to approximately $33.9 million, as stated.\n\n### 4. Purchased $16.3 million of common stock\nThe document includes the following information on purchases of common shares for treasury:\n- Purchases of common shares for treasury in the period ended November 30, 2023: $16,308\n\nThis confirms that the company purchased $16.3 million of common stock, as stated.\n\n### 5. Maintained zero borrowings on a $62.5 million line of credit\nThe document does not provide explicit information on the company's line of credit or borrowings. Therefore, we cannot directly confirm or refute this part of the statement.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the provided financial document, we can confirm the following:\n- Cash and cash equivalents dropped to approximately $33.9 million.\n- The company purchased $16.3 million of common stock.\n\nHowever, the document does not provide information on the net cash provided by operating activities or the company's borrowings and line of credit. Therefore, we cannot verify these aspects of the statement.\n\nThus, the statement is partially entailed by the given financial document. **Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

            " To determine the entailment or refutation of the statement, let's break down the key points and analyze the provided financial document to find supporting or contradicting data.\n\nThe statement contains the following key points:\n\n1. Houlihan Lokey, Inc. relies on complex fee structures.\n2. Completion Fees are recognized at the point of transaction closure for Corporate Finance (CF) and Financial Restructuring (FR) engagements.\n3. The FR segment also involves over-time recognized Retainer and Progress Fees.\n4. The company maintains a consistent Compensation Ratio across increased revenue periods.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the fee structure (Complex fee structures and types of fees)**\n\nThe financial document does not explicitly describe the fee structure or the types of fees such as Completion Fees, Retainer Fees, or Progress Fees. However, it does provide revenue data segmented by Corporate Finance, Financial Restructuring, and Financial and Valuation Advisory.\n\n**Step 2: Revenue recognition and segment performance**\n\nFrom the \"Revenues by segment\" data (paragraph id = 126), we can observe the revenues for CF and FR segments. There is indeed an increase in revenue for the FR segment (33% for the nine months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022). However, there's no explicit information about the recognition of Completion Fees or over-time recognized Retainer and Progress Fees.\n\n**Step 3: Compensation Ratio**\n\nThe statement mentions a consistent Compensation Ratio. To analyze this, we can look at the \"Operating expenses: Employee compensation and benefits\" data (paragraph id = 1). The Compensation Ratio can be approximated by dividing employee compensation and benefits by revenues.\n\n- For the three months ended December 31, 2023: Compensation Ratio = 324,039 / 511,130 = 63.4%\n- For the three months ended December 31, 2022: Compensation Ratio = 289,348 / 456,499 = 63.4%\n\nThe Compensation Ratio appears consistent between these two periods.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the provided financial document, the statement about the consistent Compensation Ratio is supported. However, the document does not provide explicit information about the complex fee structures or the specific types of fees recognized for CF and FR engagements. Therefore, the given statement is neither entirely entailed nor refuted based on the available data.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **neither entailed nor refuted**."

Decrease in Net Loss by 202%\nTo verify this, we look at the net loss figures for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022.\n- Net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2023: $277,976 (negative value)\n- Net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2022: $91,961 (negative value)\n\nCalculate the percentage change in net loss:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Change} = \\frac{\\text{New Value} - \\text{Old Value}}{\\text{Old Value}} \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Change} = \\frac{-277,976 - (-91,961)}{-91,961} \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Change} = \\frac{-186,015}{-91,961} \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Change} = 2.0223 \\times 100 = 202.23\\% \\]\n\nThe net loss increased by 202.23%. However, since it's an increase (because both values are negative), we need to verify if there is a typo in the statement confusing decrease with increase.\n\n### 2. Goodwill Impairment Charge of $198.8 Million\nFrom the financial document, the goodwill impairment for the three months ended December 31, 2023, is listed under \"Adjustments\":\n- Goodwill impairment: $198.8 million\n\nThis matches the given statement.\n\n### 3. Total Operating Expenses Increased by 136%\nTo verify this, we look at the total operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022:\n- Total operating expenses for December 31, 2023: $301,146\n- Total operating expenses for December 31, 2022: $127,851\n\nCalculate the percentage change in operating expenses:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Change} = \\frac{301,146 - 127,851}{127,851} \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Change} = \\frac{173,295}{127,851} \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Change} = 1.35567 \\times 100 = 135.567\\% \\]\n\nTotal operating expenses increased by 135.567%.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe statement mentions a decrease in net loss, but the calculations show an increase in net loss by 202.23%. The goodwill impairment charge of $198.8 million and the increase in total operating expenses by 136% (closely matching our calculated 135.567%) are correct.\n\nTherefore, the statement is partially correct except for the confusion between the decrease and increase in net loss.\n\nThe conclusion:\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

To verify this, we look for any revenue line item in the \"STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\" for the year 2023. There is no revenue line item listed, which implies that the company had no revenues in 2023.\n\n2. **Net Loss for the Year**: The statement also mentions a net loss for the year 2023. The \"STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\" shows a net loss of $415,479 for the year 2023, confirming this part of the statement.\n\n3. **Need for Additional Working Capital**: The statement mentions the need for additional working capital. While the document does not explicitly state this need, we can infer it from the negative cash flow from operating activities ($375,989) and the overall decrease in cash from $25,550 in 2022 to $20,408 in 2023, as seen in the \"STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\".\n\n4. **Related Party Transactions for Consulting Services**: The statement mentions related party transactions for consulting services. While the provided document does not detail related party transactions explicitly, it does not contradict this part of the statement either.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the financial document supports the claims of no revenues in 2023 and a net loss for the year. The need for additional working capital can be inferred from the cash flow data. The document neither confirms nor denies the engagement in related party transactions for consulting services. However, since the statement does not claim these transactions had a specific impact on the company's financials, their absence in the document does not refute the statement.\n\nTherefore, the statement is entailed."

This supports the first part of the statement about the cost of sales increasing.\n\n### Point 2: General and Administrative Expenses\nThe statement mentions that general and administrative expenses increased to $1,492,651 in 2023, up from $5,999 in the previous year.\n\nFrom the financial document:\n- **Consolidated Statements of Operations** (Operating Expenses section):\n  - For the three months ended December 31, 2023:\n    - **General and administrative**: $1,496,708\n  - For the three months ended December 31, 2022:\n    - **General and administrative**: $5,599\n\nThese figures show that the general and administrative expenses indeed increased significantly, from $5,599 to $1,496,708, but the exact amount given in the statement ($1,492,651) does not match precisely.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe financial document supports the general trend described in the statement:\n- The cost of sales increased significantly.\n- The general and administrative expenses increased significantly.\n\nHowever, the specific amount of general and administrative expenses given in the statement ($1,492,651) does not match the document exactly ($1,496,708). Therefore, the statement is mostly accurate in trend but not in exact figures.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

Uranium is Niger\u2019s main export and this small West African country holds the 7th largest uranium resource in the world and was producing about 5% of global production... Niger\u2019s Junta has threatened the export of uranium to France which has serious implications because France acquires 20% of its natural uranium from Niger. Subsequently, French President Macron has visited Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, both former Soviet Republics, citing the vast potential for further cooperation in regard to nuclear power.\"\n\nThis paragraph clearly indicates that geopolitical instability in Niger is affecting the uranium supply, as it mentions the disruption caused by the new military junta and its impact on uranium exports.\n\n#### Claim 2: Uncertainty in securing additional capital for ongoing operations\n**[paragraph id = 56]** and **[paragraph id = 301]** address the company's need for additional capital:\n> \"Our ability to become a successful operating mining company is contingent on whether we can continue to access adequate operating capital... The availability of such funds whenever such additional financing is required, will be dependent on many factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the market price of uranium, the continuing public support of nuclear power as a viable source of electricity generation, the volatility in the global financial markets affecting our stock price and the status of the worldwide economy.\"\n\n> \"Our ability to continue our operations and to pay our obligations when they become due is contingent upon us obtaining additional financing. Management\u2019s plans include seeking to procure additional funds through debt and equity financings, to secure regulatory approval licenses to fully utilize our Kinetic Separation, to construct Maverick Minerals Processing Plant for the processing of uranium and vanadium and to incorporate Kinetic Separation in the processing uranium and vanadium bearing materials to generate operating cash flows.\"\n\nThese paragraphs clearly show that the company faces uncertainty in securing additional capital due to various external factors.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\nBoth claims in the statement are supported by the provided document. The document explicitly mentions geopolitical instability in Niger affecting uranium supply and the company's need for additional capital amid uncertainty.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

Restriction on redeeming more than 15% of shares sold in the IPO.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze ownership of founder shares and potential conflicts of interest**\n- Paragraph [id=112] shows that Denali Capital Global Investments LLC (the sponsor) owns 1,932,500 Class B ordinary shares, which is approximately 93.7% of the class. This significant ownership could indeed lead to potential conflicts of interest for management in evaluating a target business.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze redemption rights for public shareholders**\n- Paragraph [id=26] discusses redemption rights for public shareholders and mentions a restriction on redeeming shares.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the restriction on redeeming shares**\n- Paragraph [id=26] explicitly states that a public shareholder is restricted from redeeming their shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the IPO without prior consent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe financial document supports all points mentioned in the statement. Management's ownership of founder shares may lead to potential conflicts of interest, and the document discusses redemption rights for public shareholders, including a restriction on redeeming more than 15% of shares sold in the IPO.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

            " To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we'll break it down into its main assertions and examine the information provided in the financial document:\n\n1. **Primary revenue stream as voyage chartering**:\n   - The statement claims that one of the primary revenue streams of OSG is voyage chartering. We'll verify this by exploring the provided document sections related to revenues.\n\n2. **Expenses absorbed by OSG**:\n   - The expenses associated with the voyage charters are absorbed by the company itself. We need to look into any relevant expense details related to chartering.\n\n3. **Decrease in voyage charter revenues in 2023 compared to 2022**:\n   - The statement asserts that voyage charter revenues decreased from 2022 to 2023. We'll compare the voyage charter revenues from both years in the provided revenue data.\n\n4. **Contribution from Hilcorp North Slope LLC**:\n   - The statement mentions that Hilcorp North Slope LLC was a key customer contributing 14.3% of the revenues in 2023. We need to find any information related to key customers or specific revenue contributions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Step 1: Primary Revenue Stream as Voyage Chartering\nLet\u2019s examine the revenue figures for 2023 and 2022 to see the proportions of time charter and voyage charter revenues.\n\n**Financial Data from the Document:**\n```\n| Years Ended December 31, |\n| 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |\n| Shipping Revenues: |\n| Time charter revenues | $ | 359,543 | $ | 327,329 | $ | 254,744 |\n| Voyage charter revenues | 92,328 | 139,471 | 104,318 |\n| Total shipping revenues | 451,871 | 466,800 | 359,062 |\n```\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **2023:** Time charter = $359,543; Voyage charter = $92,328\n- **2022:** Time charter = $327,329; Voyage charter = $139,471\n\nWhile time charter revenues are higher, voyage charter revenues still represent a significant portion of total shipping revenues.\n\n#### Step 2: Expenses Absorbed by OSG\nThe statement mentions that expenses such as fuel and port charges are absorbed by OSG. We need to look for details on such expenses.\n\nThe data from the document provides operational expenses but does not specifically itemize expenses such as fuel and port charges:\n```\n| Years Ended December 31, |\n| 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |\n| Operating Expenses: |\n| Voyage expenses | 28,344 | 40,472 | 66,467 |\n| Vessel expenses | 166,246 | 176,666 | 140,413 |\n| Charter hire expenses | 64,971 | 88,849 | 90,166 |\n| Depreciation and amortization | 67,164 | 70,637 | 61,823 |\n| General and administrative | 28,223 | 26,985 | 24,097 |\n| Total operating expenses | 354,948 | 403,609 | 388,162 |\n```\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The \"Voyage expenses\" likely include fuel and port charges, but the detailed breakdown is not available. It is assumed that such expenses are accounted for in the operating expenses since there is no refutation.\n\n#### Step 3: Decrease in Voyage Charter Revenues\nWe need to compare voyage charter revenues between 2023 and 2022:\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **2023:** Voyage charter revenues = $9"

However, marketing expenses are not explicitly stated. Instead, we have general and administrative expenses, which may include marketing costs.\n\n     **General and Administrative Expenses:**\n     - For the year 2024: $21,336 thousand\n     - For the year 2023: $16,958 thousand\n\n     Let's calculate the percentage change:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage Change} = \\frac{21,336 - 16,958}{16,958} \\times 100 \\approx 25.8\\%\n     \\]\n\n2. **Significant Capital Expenditures:**\n   - Capital expenditures are generally referred to as \"Real estate acquisition and development expense\" in the provided document.\n\n     **Real Estate Acquisition and Development Expenses:**\n     - For the year 2024: $3,717 thousand\n     - For the year 2023: $5,481 thousand\n\n     The statement states \"significant capital expenditures,\" but the actual expenses show a decrease.\n\n3. **Net Operating Income from Newly Acquired Facilities:**\n   - The document provides detailed net operating income for acquired facilities.\n\n     **Net Operating Income from Acquired Facilities:**\n     - For the year 2024: $37,171 thousand\n     - For the year 2023: $6,228 thousand\n\n     The increase in net operating income indicates continued generation from newly acquired facilities.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **Marketing Expenses:** The document does not separate marketing expenses specifically, and the general and administrative expenses show a 25.8% increase, not 40.4%.\n- **Capital Expenditures:** The reported numbers for real estate acquisition and development expenses show a decrease, not a significant increase.\n- **Net Operating Income from Newly Acquired Facilities:** This part of the statement is accurate with a significant increase in net operating income from newly acquired facilities.\n\nGiven the discrepancies in marketing expenses and capital expenditures, the statement is not entirely supported by the document.\n\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, the statement is **refuted**."

After redemptions and conversions, 5,621,910 Class A Ordinary Shares were left outstanding.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

This shows a significant increase in professional fees, which could be the primary reason for the increased loss in 2023.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Number of Treasury Shares Redeemed\n- From the \"Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders\u2019 Equity (Deficit)\" for 2023, there is a line item \"Cancellation of stock issued for prepaid services\" showing $45,000 for 691,250 shares.\n- Similarly, for 2022, there is a line item \"Redemption of previously issued commitment shares\" showing $41,250 for 41,250 shares.\n\n### Step 4: Confirm the Reason for the Redemption of Treasury Shares\n- Both in 2023 and 2022, the redemption of treasury shares is related to the cancellation of stock issued for prepaid services and the redemption of previously issued commitment shares, respectively. This supports the statement that the redemptions were due to termination agreements for non-performance.\n\n### Conclusion\nAll parts of the statement are supported by the financial document:\n- The company faced a larger loss of $2,817,340 in 2023 compared to $1,656,019 in 2022.\n- The increased loss is mainly due to increased professional fees.\n- The company redeemed 691,250 treasury shares in 2023 and 41,250 in 2022.\n- The redemptions were a result of termination agreements for non-performance.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

            " To determine whether the given statement is entailed or refuted by the provided financial document, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant information in the document related to Nate Knight's options:**\n\n   According to the paragraphs [352] and [363], Nate Knight was granted 1,667 options from the Company\u2019s 2021 Plan with immediate vesting, at an exercise price of $3.30, and expiration of March 2028. Specifically, paragraph [363] states:\n\n   ```\"\n   [paragraph id = 363] Nate Knight Options On March 16, 2023, Michael A. Wright resigned from the Board and was replaced by Nate Knight. Mr. Knight has been granted under the Company\u2019s 2021 plan five year vested non-statutory options to purchase 1,667 common shares at an exercise price of $3.30 per share exercisable at any time after the date of grant. He will also receive the same cash consideration per month that is paid to other Board members.\n   ```\n\n2. **Examine the data related to Nate Knight's options as of December 31, 2023:**\n\n   Paragraph [387] provides information regarding the beneficial ownership of shares, including those under options and warrants, as follows:\n\n   ```\"\n   [paragraph id = 387] | Name and Address of Beneficial Owner | Shares of Common Stock | Number of Shares Underlying Convertible Preferred Stock, Options and Warrants | Total Shares Beneficially Owned | Percentage of Shares Beneficially Owned (%) |\n   | Directors and Executive Officers |\n   ...\n   | Nate Knight | \u2013 | 51,667 | 51,667 | * |\n   ```\n\n   From this, we see that Nate Knight holds options for 51,667 shares in total, but this figure includes all his options, not just the ones granted on March 16, 2023.\n\n3. **Analyze the value of Nate Knight's options:**\n\n   The statement to be verified mentions a specific value of Nate Knight's options granted on March 16, 2023, is $4,835.44. To verify this, we need to know the average exercise price and the value of the options as of December 31, 2023.\n\n   However, the document does not directly specify the current value of Nate Knight's options. Hence, we refer to the average exercise price information given in paragraph [360]:\n\n   ```\"\n   | Number of Shares Subject to Options/Warrants | Average Exercise Price ($) per Share | Value of Unexercised Options/ Warrants at Dec. 31, 2023 (1) |\n   ...\n   | Nate Knight | 51,667 | $ 2.40 | $ \u2013 |\n   ```\n\n   The average exercise price per share for Nate Knight's options is $2.40, but the document does not state how this average was calculated or the specific value of options granted on March 16, 2023.\n\n4. **Evaluate the statement:**\n\n   Given that the provided financial document lacks the explicit value of $4,835.44 for Nate Knight's options granted specifically on March 16, 2023, and only provides an average exercise price without specific value information, the statement cannot be supported by the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

Agencies Securities:**\n   - The data for U.S. govt. agencies securities is found in paragraph id 62.\n\n2. **Extract Unrealized Gain/Loss Data:**\n   - For December 31, 2023, the unrealized gain (loss) is stated as $(33) for U.S. govt. agencies securities.\n   - For December 31, 2022, the unrealized gain (loss) is stated as $(169) for U.S. govt. agencies securities.\n\n3. **Calculate the Percentage Change:**\n   - To find the percentage change between the two unrealized gain (loss) values, we use the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage Change} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{New Value} - \\text{Old Value}}{\\text{Old Value}} \\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the values from the document, we get:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percentage Change} = \\left( \\frac{(-33) - (-169)}{-169} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{-33 + 169}{-169} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{136}{-169} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx -80.47\\%\n     \\]\n   - The negative sign indicates an improvement, so the actual improvement is 80.47%.\n\n4. **Comparison with the Statement:**\n   - The statement to verify is: \"The total unrealized gain (loss) on U.S. govt. agencies securities changed from (169) in 2022 to (33) in 2023, which represents a 80.47% improvement.\"\n   - Our calculated percentage change matches the given statement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement is supported by the data provided in the financial document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

            " To verify the statement, we need to examine the financial document to identify the redemption of common stock in 2022 and 2023 and their respective impacts on the trust account balance. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Trust Account Balance:**\n   - The statement claims an initial trust account balance of $114,700,001. We need to check if this amount is mentioned or can be derived from the document.\n\n2. **Find Redemptions in 2022 and 2023:**\n   - Identify the amounts related to the redemption of common stock in the years 2022 and 2023.\n\n3. **Calculate the Ending Trust Account Balance:**\n   - Determine the ending balance of the trust account for 2023 and verify if it matches the amount stated ($12,977,528).\n\n4. **Compare the Impact of Redemptions:**\n   - Verify if the redemptions account for the difference between the initial and final trust account balances.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Initial Trust Account Balance:**\n   - The document does not explicitly state an initial trust account balance of $114,700,001. Instead, it mentions:\n     - \"For the year ended December 31, 2022, cash used in investing activities was $100,376,090 which was due to investment in the Trust Account of $1,400,840, a redemption of common stock of $101,545,684, and a withdrawal of interest income from the Trust Account of $231,246.\" (paragraph id = 264)\n     - This suggests significant redemption in 2022 but doesn't provide an initial balance.\n\n2. **Redemptions in 2022 and 2023:**\n   - For 2022:\n     - \"Cash used in investing activities was $100,376,090 which was due to... a redemption of common stock of $101,545,684\" (paragraph id = 264)\n   - For 2023:\n     - \"Cash used in investing activities was $5,308,141 which was due to... a redemption of common stock of $5,627,005\" (paragraph id = 263)\n\n3. **Ending Trust Account Balance:**\n   - The ending balance of the trust account for 2023 is stated as $12,977,528 (paragraph id = 351).\n\n4. **Comparing the Impact of Redemptions:**\n   - Sum of redemptions from 2022 and 2023: $101,545,684 (2022) + $5,627,005 (2023) = $107,172,689\n   - The difference between the alleged initial balance ($114,700,001) and the final balance ($12,977,528) is $101,722,473 (which is close but not precisely equal to $107,172,689).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe redemption amounts and the trust account balances given in the document do not align with the initial and final balances mentioned in the statement. Specifically, no initial balance of $114,700,001 is verified, and the total redemption amount ($107,172,689) does not exactly match the calculated difference from the alleged initial to the final balance.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

This analysis assumes stock-based compensation is the only disclosed cost of revenues component available for these calculations.\n\n2. **Calculate the Proportion of Cost of Revenues to Total Revenues:**\n\n   - **Proportion for 2023:**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Proportion (2023)} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Revenues (2023)}}{\\text{Total Revenues (2023)}} = \\frac{5,584}{264,831} \\approx 2.108\\%\n     \\]\n\n   - **Proportion for 2022:**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Proportion (2022)} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Revenues (2022)}}{\\text{Total Revenues (2022)}} = \\frac{4,389}{204,270} \\approx 2.148\\%\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Change in Proportion:**\n\n   - **Change in Proportion:**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Change in Proportion} = \\text{Proportion (2023)} - \\text{Proportion (2022)} = 2.108\\% - 2.148\\% = -0.04\\%\n     \\]\n\n   This shows a reduction of 0.04% points, not 1.4% points as stated.\n\n4. **Determine the Gross Margin Percentage Change:**\n\n   - **Gross Margin Percentage (GMP):**\n     \\[\n     \\text{GMP} = 100\\% - \\text{Proportion of Cost of Revenues}\n     \\]\n\n   - **GMP for 2023:**\n     \\[\n     \\text{GMP (2023)} = 100\\% - 2.108\\% \\approx 97.892\\%\n     \\]\n\n   - **GMP for 2022:**\n     \\[\n     \\text{GMP (2022)} = 100\\% - 2.148\\% \\approx 97.852\\%\n     \\]\n\n   - **Change in Gross Margin Percentage:**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Change in GMP} = \\text{GMP (2023)} - \\text{GMP (2022)} = 97.892\\% - 97.852\\% = 0.04\\%\n     \\]\n\n   This shows an increase of 0.04% points, not 2.6% points as stated.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the calculated values, the statement claiming a reduction of 1.4% points in the proportion of cost of revenues to total revenues and a resulting 2.6% points increase in gross margin percentage is incorrect.

This interest expense comprises 5.7% of total revenue.\n3. $3.9 million of the interest expense arises from promissory notes.\n4. $560,000 of the interest expense arises from the construction loan.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**1. Total Interest Expense:**\n- From the financial statement (paragraph id = 1), the interest expense for the period ending December 31, 2023, is $4,216 thousand.\n\n**2. Interest Expense as a Percentage of Total Revenue:**\n- Total revenue for the period ending December 31, 2023, is $73,907 thousand (paragraph id = 1).\n- Calculating the percentage of interest expense to total revenue:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{4,216}{73,907} \\times 100 \\approx 5.7\\%\n  \\]\n\n**3. Breakdown of Interest Expense:**\n- The financial document does not provide a specific breakdown of interest expense into promissory notes and construction loans.\n- However, it states the total interest expense as $4,216 thousand, which we already verified.\n\nGiven the above steps, we can conclude:\n- The total interest expense for the period ending December 31, 2023, is indeed around $4.216 million, which is approximately 5.7% of total revenue.\n- However, the breakdown of $3.9 million from promissory notes and $560,000 from the construction loan cannot be verified from the given document as it does not provide this specific detail.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe total interest expense and its percentage of total revenue are correct according to the provided financial document. However, the statement about the breakdown into promissory notes and construction loans cannot be verified due to lack of detail in the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is partially refuted.

However, the provided document does not explicitly mention TLAC values. We'll assume that the TLAC-related information might be embedded within the balance sheet or other comprehensive income sections.\n\n**Step 2: Extracting Data**\n\nSince the provided document does not include explicit TLAC figures, we are unable to directly extract the necessary data points for calculation. If TLAC data were provided, we would look for the Total Eligible Balance for TLAC as of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Percentage Growth**\n\nIf we were able to extract the TLAC values (let's denote them as \\( \\text{TLAC}_{2024} \\) and \\( \\text{TLAC}_{2023} \\)), we would use the following formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Growth} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{TLAC}_{2024} - \\text{TLAC}_{2023}}{\\text{TLAC}_{2023}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n\\]\n\nHowever, without the actual TLAC figures, we cannot perform this calculation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven that the provided financial document does not include specific TLAC values, we cannot verify the statement regarding the percentage growth in Total Eligible Balance for TLAC.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**.\n\nThe statement is refuted because the financial document does not provide the necessary data to calculate the percentage growth in Total Eligible Balance for TLAC from December 31, 2023, to March 31, 2024."

This salary is for the period from January 1, 2023, to May 31, 2023 (5 months), as his salary increased effective June 1, 2023.\n\n2. **Calculating Initial Salary**:\n   - Annual salary before June 1, 2023: $400,000 (from paragraph id = 247)\n   - Salary for 5 months: \\( \\frac{5}{12} \\times 400,000 = \\frac{2,000,000}{12} = 166,666.67 \\) (approximately $166,667)\n\n3. **Calculating New Salary from June 1, 2023**:\n   - New annual salary effective June 1, 2023: $600,000 (from paragraph id = 247)\n   - Salary for 7 months: \\( \\frac{7}{12} \\times 600,000 = \\frac{4,200,000}{12} = 350,000 \\)\n\n4. **Total Salary for 2023**:\n   - Total salary for 2023: \\( 166,667 + 350,000 = 516,667 \\)\n\n5. **Adding Bonus**:\n   - Bonus for 2023: $100,000 (from the Summary Compensation Table)\n\n6. **Adding Stock Awards and Option Awards**:\n   - Stock Awards for 2023: $0\n   - Option Awards for 2023: $272,307 (from the Summary Compensation Table)\n\n7. **Adding Other Payments**:\n   - Other payments for 2023: $272,307 (listed under Option Awards in the Summary Compensation Table)\n\n8. **Total Compensation for 2023**:\n   - Total compensation: \\( 516,667 + 100,000 + 0 + 272,307 + 272,307 = 1,161,281 \\)\n\nTherefore, the calculated total compensation for Robert M. Hayes in 2023 is approximately $1,161,281.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement claims that the total compensation for Robert M. Hayes in 2023, adjusted for the change in annual compensation starting June 1, 2023, is $1,038,973. However, our detailed calculation shows that the total compensation is $1,161,281.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

Cassaday\n     Chief Financial Officer\n     (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer)\n     ```\n\n   The document lists two individual signatories: Rajiv Shukla and Bryan J. Cassaday.\n\n3. **Compare the Counted Number with the Statement**:\n   - The statement claims there are 9 signatories, but the document only lists 2 individual signatories and one accounting firm.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe total number of document signatories listed for Carmell Corporation as of April 1, 2024, is 2, not 9.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - We need the revenue figures for the technology segment for the years 2022 and 2023. The document provides data for the first quarters of 2024 and 2023 but does not explicitly state the technology segment revenue.\n   - We should refer to the \"SALES - NET\" section in the Condensed Statements of Operations for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2024, and March 31, 2023.\n\n2. **Extract Revenue Figures**:\n   - Sales - Net for the three months ended March 31, 2023: $305,089\n   - Sales - Net for the three months ended March 31, 2024: $356,061\n\n3. **Calculate the Growth Rate**:\n   To calculate the growth rate from 2022 to 2023, we would need the revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2022. However, this data is not provided in the document. Therefore, we cannot calculate the growth rate from 2022 to 2023.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the financial document does not provide the revenue figures for the three months ended March 31, 2022, we cannot verify the statement regarding the growth rate of the technology segment revenue from 2022 to 2023.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted because the necessary data to calculate the growth rate is missing from the document.

Specifically:\n     - **Deferred underwriting fee payable**: $8,050,000.\n     - **Warrant liabilities**: $2,090,000.\n     - **Note payable\u2014Sponsor**: $4,853,225.\n     - **Note payable\u2014Related Party**: $600,000.\n     - **Working Capital Loan\u2014Related Party**: $17,935.\n     - **Advances from Related Parties**: $110,770.\n\n3. **Calculation of Reduction**:\n   - We need to calculate the total amount of liabilities and expenses that could potentially reduce the trust account.\n   - Total liabilities and expenses = $8,050,000 (Deferred underwriting fee payable) + $2,090,000 (Warrant liabilities) + $4,853,225 (Note payable\u2014Sponsor) + $600,000 (Note payable\u2014Related Party) + $17,935 (Working Capital Loan\u2014Related Party) + $110,770 (Advances from Related Parties) = $15,721,930.\n\n4. **Effect on Trust Account**:\n   - The document specifies that if third parties bring claims, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced. Similarly, the payment of the aforementioned liabilities and expenses would reduce the trust account.\n   - Total trust account as of December 31, 2023: $72,731,536.\n   - Reduced by liabilities and expenses: $72,731,536 - $15,721,930 = $57,009,606.\n\n5. **Calculation of Redemption Value per Share**:\n   - The number of shares subject to possible redemption as of December 31, 2023: 6,489,246 shares.\n   - New redemption value per share = $57,009,606 / 6,489,246 shares = $8.79 per share.\n\nHowever, considering the exact attorney fees and other liabilities might be different, the redemption amount per share upon liquidation could indeed be as low as $9.29 as stated.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe financial document supports that the redemption amount per share upon liquidation could be reduced to around $8.79 if all potential liabilities and expenses are considered.

To find the segment earnings for Seating on March 30, 2024, we first need to find the total segment earnings as a percentage of total net sales. We can use the consolidated net income percentage for this ( paragraph id = 153):\n   - Consolidated net income percentage: 1.8%\n5. Now, we can calculate the total segment earnings by applying this percentage to the total net sales:\n   - Total segment earnings = Total net sales * Consolidated net income percentage\n   - Total segment earnings = $5,994.6 million * 1.8% = $107.9 million\n6. Next, we find the segment earnings for Seating by applying its net sales percentage to the total segment earnings:\n   - Seating segment earnings = Total segment earnings * Seating net sales percentage\n   - Seating segment earnings = $107.9 million * 74.7% = $80.7 million\n7.

Recorded Net Losses for 2023 and 2022\nThe financial document provides the following data for net losses:\n- Net loss for 2023: $9,841,638\n- Net loss for 2022: $4,639,662\n\n### 2. Calculating the Increase in Net Loss\nTo find out if the net loss for 2023 was more than double the net loss for 2022, we will calculate the percentage increase in net loss:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Loss 2023} - \\text{Net Loss 2022}}{\\text{Net Loss 2022}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{9,841,638 - 4,639,662}{4,639,662} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 112\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Analysis of Increased Costs\nThe document also provides details on changes in R&D and G&A expenses:\n- R&D expenses: $1,605,547 in 2023 and $2,280,933 in 2022; a decrease of $675,386 (30%)\n- G&A expenses: $8,521,103 in 2023 and $6,457,860 in 2022; an increase of $2,063,243 (32%)\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Statement\nThe statement claims that the total net loss for 2023 was more than double the net loss for 2022 due to increased costs in R&D and G&A expenses. However, we have observed the following:\n- The net loss for 2023 was indeed more than double the net loss for 2022 (112% increase).\n- The R&D expenses actually decreased by 30%, not increased.\n- The G&A expenses increased by 32%, which partially supports the statement.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven that the net loss for 2023 was more than double that of 2022, the first part of the statement is correct. However, the statement is incorrect regarding increased costs in R&D, as the R&D expenses actually decreased. Therefore, the statement is partially accurate but misleading due to the incorrect mention of increased R&D costs.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

Additionally, 500,000 shares were issued for $500,000, and 250,000 shares were issued to White Lion for its commitments under the Common Stock Purchase Agreement.\n\nTotal shares purchased in July 2023:\n\\[ 9,250,000 + 500,000 + 250,000 = 10,000,000 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Dividend Income\nGiven the dividend rate is 8% per share on the original issue price of $1.00, the dividend per share is:\n\\[ 8\\% \\times \\$1.00 = \\$0.08 \\]\n\nTotal dividend income for 10,000,000 shares:\n\\[ 10,000,000 \\times \\$0.08 = \\$800,000 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Effective Dividend Yield\nThe effective dividend yield is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Dividend Yield} = \\frac{\\text{Dividend Income}}{\\text{Investment Value}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Dividend Yield} = \\frac{\\$800,000}{\\$10,000,000} = 8\\% \\]\n\n### Step 5: Verify Investment Held Throughout 2023\nThe investment was made in July 2023 and held throughout the remainder of the year. The dividend rate of 8% was assumed to be applied annually.\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, based on the provided financial document and the calculations, the effective dividend yield for Estrella Series A Preferred Stock, assuming it was held throughout 2023, is indeed 8% of the investment value made in July 2023.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

The changes in selling, general, and administrative expenses.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Revenue Increase Percentage for NRS Segment**\n\nFrom paragraph id = 21 (Disaggregated Revenues), we observe the following:\n- Revenue for the three months ended January 31, 2024: $25,223 thousand\n- Revenue for the three months ended January 31, 2023: $19,822 thousand\n\nThe revenue increase percentage is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Revenue Increase Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{25,223 - 19,822}{19,822} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Revenue Increase Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{5,401}{19,822} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\approx 27.25\\% \\]\n\nThis confirms the 27.2% increase in total revenues for the NRS segment.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Change in Operating Income**\n\nThe statement mentions a slight decrease in operating income by 0.5%. We need to verify if this data is available in the document. Unfortunately, the document does not provide explicit operating income figures. Thus, we cannot confirm the operating income change directly from the provided data.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses**\n\nFrom paragraph id = 112 (Depreciation and amortization), we observe the following:\n- Depreciation and amortization included in \"Selling, general and administrative expense\" for the three months ended January 31, 2024: $0.7 million\n- Depreciation and amortization included in \"Selling, general and administrative expense\" for the three months ended January 31, 2023: $0.6 million\n\nThe document does not provide total selling, general, and administrative expenses, only depreciation and amortization. Without the full expense data, we cannot determine if there were higher proportional increases in these expenses.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince the document does not provide explicit operating income figures or detailed selling, general, and administrative expenses, we cannot verify the statement regarding the slight decrease in operating income or the increases in selling, general, and administrative expenses. However, we have confirmed the 27.2% increase in total revenues for the NRS segment.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** due to lack of sufficient data to confirm the operating income decrease and expense increases."

The dog products and services retail industry, in particular on the Internet, is highly competitive and we expect this competition to continue to increase.\"** (Paragraph ID = 184)\n\n2. **Competition from Larger Competitors**:\n   - The document highlights that BARK faces competition from various retailers, including those with longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger fulfillment infrastructures, and significantly greater financial, marketing, and other resources.\n   - **\"Many of these current competitors have, and potential competitors may have, longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger fulfillment infrastructures, greater technical capabilities, significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources and larger customer bases than we do, allowing our competitors to derive greater net sales and profits from their existing customer base, acquire customers at lower costs or respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in consumer preferences or habits.\"** (Paragraph ID = 184)\n\n3. **Need for Economies of Scale**:\n   - While the document does not explicitly mention \"economies of scale,\" the need to compete with larger competitors inherently implies the importance of economies of scale. Larger competitors can leverage their resources more efficiently to achieve lower per-unit costs.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement mentions challenges in establishing a competitive edge due to high competitive rivalry and the need for economies of scale. The financial document supports both these points:\n\n- **High competitive rivalry**: The document acknowledges the highly competitive nature of the industry and BARK's competition with various types of retailers.\n- **Need for economies of scale**: The document implicitly refers to the advantages of larger competitors, such as greater financial resources and established market presence, which are aspects of economies of scale.\n\nTherefore, the statement is entailed by the document.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, the statement is **entailed**."

Evans owns 1,432,468 shares.\n\n2. **Total Shares Outstanding:**\n   - The total shares outstanding as of November 30, 2023, is 7,263,508 shares.\n\n3. **Calculation of Ownership Percentage:**\n   - We need to calculate the ownership percentage to verify if Michael W. Evans owns nearly 20% of the company.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Ownership Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{1,432,468}{7,263,508} \\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n\n     Performing the calculation:\n     \\[\n     1,432,468 / 7,263,508 \\approx 0.1972 \\text{ or } 19.72\\%\n     \\]\n\n4. **Analysis of the Ownership Percentage:**\n   - The ownership of 19.72% confirms that Michael W. Evans owns nearly 20% of the company.\n\n5. **Potential Impact on Impartiality:**\n   - The statement suggests that directors may face difficulties remaining impartial in oversight, especially if the company is tightly held. Given the significant ownership by Michael W. Evans, the potential for influence on decision-making and oversight is plausible.\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the statement is entailed by the provided financial document as Michael W. Evans does own nearly 20% of BAB, Inc., and the potential concerns regarding impartial oversight are valid based on the significant ownership stake.\n\n### Final Determination\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

Whether there is any evidence of the company's compliance with its financial covenants and if the increase in debt-related expenses could challenge this compliance.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Interest Rate Increase due to the Third Amended Credit Agreement**:\n   - There is no explicit mention of the \"Third Amended Credit Agreement\" or an interest rate increase of 25 basis points in the provided document.\n   - We do see interest expense, net amounts and their percentage changes for the three and six months ended periods but no direct reference to a basis points increase due to an amended credit agreement.\n\n2. **Increase in Interest Expense**:\n   - For the three months ended December 31, 2023, interest expense, net was $4,611, increased from $4,143 in the previous period.\n   - For the six months ended December 31, 2023, interest expense, net was $8,093, increased from $6,964 in the previous period.\n   - This indicates an increase in interest expense, but without reference to a specific amendment or basis points increase, we cannot tie this directly to the Third Amended Credit Agreement.\n\n3. **Compliance with Financial Covenants**:\n   - The document does not provide explicit details regarding the company's financial covenants or compliance challenges related to them.\n\n4. **Improvement in Gross Margin**:\n   - The document does show the gross profit and cost of revenues for the periods in question:\n     - For the three months ended December 31, 2023, the gross profit was $355,697 on net revenues of $822,054, and for the six months ended, it was $457,625 on net revenues of $1,091,104.\n     - Comparably, the gross profits for the previous periods were $367,766 and $469,224, respectively.\n   - However, without computing the gross margins and showing an improvement specifically mentioned for fiscal 2024, this piece of information is inconclusive.\n\nGiven the lack of explicit information on changes due to the Third Amended Credit Agreement and the absence of discussion on the financial covenants, we cannot verify the statement based on the provided document.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

We need to locate any mention of deferred tax assets and valuation allowances in the financial document.\n\n2. **Analyze the Provided Financial Tables and Notes:**\n   - Look for any entries related to deferred tax assets in the consolidated financial statements, specifically in the balance sheet (December 31, 2023 and 2022), income statement, and notes to the financial statements.\n\n3. **Confirm the Valuation Allowance Amount:**\n   - The statement refers to a valuation allowance of $126.6 million. Ensure that this amount matches the figures provided in the financial document.\n\n4. **Assess Management's Skepticism and Internal Controls:**\n   - Check for any mention of management\u2019s assessment or skepticism regarding the realization of sufficient future taxable income. This could be noted in the management discussion and analysis (MD&A) section or another part of the report.\n   - Look for any disclosures related to internal controls to verify the claim of improved internal control.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n- **Balance Sheet (December 31, 2023):**\n  - **Liabilities and Equity:**\n    - Deferred Income Taxes: $12.7 million (2023) and $13.4 million (2022)\n    - There is no specific mention of a valuation allowance of $126.6 million.\n\n- **Income Statement (Year Ended December 31, 2023):**\n  - **Other Income (Expense):**\n    - Deferred income taxes adjustment of $(1.1) million (2023) and $(0.1) million (2022)\n    - No specific mention of a valuation allowance of $126.6 million.\n\n- **Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements:**\n  - Review the notes for any additional details on deferred tax assets and valuation allowances. Commonly found in notes related to accounting policies, deferred taxes, or subsequent events.\n\n- **Internal Controls:**\n  - Look for any mentions of internal control assessments or improvements noted in the management discussion and analysis or the auditor\u2019s report.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the provided financial document, there is no explicit mention of a valuation allowance of $126.6 million on deferred tax assets.

Therefore, the statement's reasoning about the causality is not explicitly supported by the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

            " To determine whether the given statement is entailed or refuted by the provided financial document, we need to carefully examine the relevant sections that discuss the company's going concern status, its ability to secure additional capital, and its current financial situation.\n\n1. **Going Concern Evaluation (Paragraph ID 272)**:\n   - The paragraph discusses the criteria and methodology the company uses to evaluate its ability to continue as a going concern. It mentions that certain elements of its operating plan cannot be considered probable because they are not entirely within the company's control and/or have not been approved by the board of directors.\n   - Importantly, it states that \"the receipt of potential funding from future partnerships, equity or debt issuances, potential achievement of milestones from customer agreements and reductions in workforce cannot be considered probable at this time because these plans are not entirely within our control and/or have not been approved by our board of directors as of the date of issuance of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\"\n\n2. **Impact of Legal Proceedings and Regulatory Investigations (Paragraph ID 154)**:\n   - This section highlights potential adverse effects on the company's financial condition, including substantial payments, fines, penalties, and increased costs due to ongoing legal proceedings and regulatory investigations. This adds to the potential financial strain on the company.\n\n3. **Valuation of Long-lived Assets (Paragraph ID 298)**:\n   - This paragraph explains how the company assesses the potential impairment of long-lived assets when the carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows. This suggests that the company is vigilant about the financial health and value of its assets but does not directly address the issue of capital raising or liquidity.\n\n4. **Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders\u2019 Equity and Consolidated Financial Statements**:\n   - The financial data provided in these tables show significant net losses and accumulated deficits. For example, in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders\u2019 Equity, there are substantial net losses and other comprehensive losses, leading to an increase in the accumulated deficit.\n\n5. **General Economic Conditions and Slow or Negative Growth of Related Markets (Paragraph ID 169)**:\n   - This section mentions various factors that could adversely affect the company's stock price and its ability to sell equity securities, including market fluctuations and the company's operating performance. This adds to the uncertainty and potential difficulties in capital raising.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- The company acknowledges substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern due to the lack of probable plans for additional funding, including equity or debt issuances.\n- The financial tables show significant losses and accumulated deficits, indicating a strained financial situation.\n- The inability to secure additional capital, coupled with the lack of authorized shares, could indeed limit strategic opportunities and operational continuity, thereby signaling a potential liquidity crisis.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed** by the financial document. The document clearly supports the idea that the company's substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern is intensified by its inability to secure additional capital due to a lack of authorized shares, signaling a potential liquidity crisis that could fundamentally limit strategic opportunities and operational continuity."

It also includes statements of changes in stockholders' deficiency, information about the acquisition of the Within / Without Granola (WWG) brand, and details about the company's financial performance and operational plans.\n\n### Statement to Verify\n\n\"The ongoing search for a new manufacturer for the Within / Without Granola products, compounded by a lack of sales in 2023, exacerbates Artisan Consumer Goods\u2019 ability to continue as a going concern, necessitating a potential impairment test for the WWG trademark deemed to have an indefinite life.\"\n\n### Steps in Analysis\n\n1. **Search for a New Manufacturer**:\n   - [Paragraph ID = 6] mentions that the company is searching for a new manufacturer for the Within / Without Granola products. As of December 31, 2023, a new manufacturer has not been engaged.\n\n2. **Lack of Sales in 2023**:\n   - [Paragraph ID = 36] states that the company generated sales of $0 for the six months ended December 31, 2023.\n\n3. **Impairment Test for the WWG Trademark**:\n   - [Paragraph ID = 22] indicates that the WWG trademark is deemed to have an indefinite life and will be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis.\n\n4. **Exacerbates Ability to Continue as a Going Concern**:\n   - The document does not explicitly mention the \"going concern\" risk, but the financial conditions indicate a significant deficiency in stockholders' equity and a net loss for the period.\n\n### Reasoning\n\n- **Ongoing search for a new manufacturer**: Verified from [Paragraph ID = 6].\n- **Lack of sales in 2023**: Confirmed from [Paragraph ID = 36].\n- **WWG trademark impairment test**: Mentioned in [Paragraph ID = 22].\n- **Exacerbates ability to continue as a going concern**: Implied from the significant stockholders' deficiency and net loss but not explicitly stated.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe given statement is supported by the document, as it accurately reflects the ongoing search for a new manufacturer, the lack of sales in 2023, and the need for an impairment test for the WWG trademark. The financial condition of the company, as indicated by the net loss and stockholders' deficiency, indirectly supports the concern about the company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

If Cadiz Inc. has $334 million federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards.\n3. If there was an ownership change in 2021 that could potentially limit the utilization of NOL carryforwards.\n4. Any indications of a potential impact on the deferred tax asset valuation strategy due to the limitations in utilizing NOL carryforwards.\n\nLet's analyze the document step by step:\n\n1. **Stock offering in 2023:**\n   In paragraph id = 137, which shows the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders\u2019 Equity, we can see that Cadiz Inc. issued 10,500,000 shares pursuant to direct offerings during 2023. The additional paid-in capital increased by $38,385,000 from $636,963,000 in 2022 to $679,150,000 in 2023. This indicates that Cadiz Inc. raised approximately $38.5 million through a stock offering in 2023.\n\n2. **Federal NOL carryforwards:**\n   The provided document does not contain explicit information about the amount of federal NOL carryforwards. Therefore, we cannot confirm the $334 million figure mentioned in the statement.\n\n3. **Ownership change in 2021:**\n   Paragraph id = 137 shows that the number of shares outstanding for common stock increased significantly from 43,656,169 in 2021 to 55,823,810 in 2022 (an increase of around 27.8%). This might indicate a significant ownership change, but the document does not provide details on whether this change occurred in 2021 or at some other point. Additionally, the document does not specify if this change would limit the utilization of NOL carryforwards.\n\n4. **Potential impact on deferred tax asset valuation strategy:**\n   The document does not provide any explicit information about the potential impact on the deferred tax asset valuation strategy due to limitations in utilizing NOL carryforwards.\n\nBased on the information available in the provided financial document, we can confirm that Cadiz Inc. raised approximately $38.5 million through a stock offering in 2023.

This information is found in paragraph id = 296.\n\n2. **Extract relevant data**:\n   - Discount rate for U.S. pension benefit obligations in 2021: 2.83%\n   - Discount rate for U.S. pension benefit obligations in 2023: 5.12%\n\n3. **Analyze the statement components**:\n   - The statement mentions a targeted asset allocation that heavily favors fixed income in its Immunizing Portfolio.

            " 1. **Understanding the Statement**:\n   - The statement claims that the company uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate stock option fair value.\n   - It also mentions the use of the present value calculation for the Norton facility lease.\n   - It concludes that these methods align with financial standards for asset valuation and risk assessment.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Document for Use of the Black-Scholes Model**:\n   - Paragraph [139] provides data related to the weighted average fair value of grants, risk-free interest rate, expected life in years, expected volatility, and expected dividend yield.\n   - This data is typically used in option pricing models. However, there is no explicit mention of the Black-Scholes model in the document.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Document for Present Value Calculation for Lease**:\n   - Paragraph [131] states that the Norton facility lease is included as a right-of-use lease asset and corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet based on the present value of remaining lease payments.\n   - This aligns with financial standards (such as ASC 842) which require lease assets and liabilities to be recognized based on the present value of lease payments.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - While the document clearly indicates the use of present value calculations for the lease, there is no explicit mention of the Black-Scholes model for stock option valuation.\n   - The provided data in paragraph [139] suggests elements typically used in option pricing models, but it does not confirm the use of the Black-Scholes model specifically.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** based on the lack of explicit mention of the Black-Scholes model in the document."

Identify Relevant Sections:**\n- The relevant sections are found in the \"CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY.\"\n- Specifically, we will focus on the paragraph discussing \"Common stock repurchased.\"\n\n**2. Extract Specific Data Points Related to the Statement:**\n- **Common stock repurchased between December 31, 2023, and March 31, 2024:**\n  - The document states, \"Common stock repurchased: \u2014 ( 70 )...\" indicating 70 shares were repurchased during this period.\n- **Change in Outstanding Shares:**\n  - From December 31, 2023, to March 31, 2024, the number of common stock shares changed from 48,799 to 48,752.\n- **Authorization Details:**\n  - The document does not explicitly mention the authorization to repurchase up to 2,500 shares, so we will go by the data provided on actual repurchases.\n\n**3. Evaluate Data for Consistency with the Statement:**\n- The statement mentions the repurchase of 70 shares in January 2024, which aligns with the data found in the document.\n- The strategy aims to reduce the outstanding share count, and this is evident from the reduction in the number of shares from 48,799 to 48,752.\n- However, the document does not mention the authorization to repurchase up to 2,500 shares explicitly. But since the focus of the statement is whether the repurchases are made and align with reducing outstanding shares, the provided data supports the action and intention.\n\nGiven these points, the provided data in the document supports the statement about the share repurchase program.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe data aligns with the statement's mention of purchasing 70 shares in January 2024 and the strategy of reducing the outstanding share count. Because of this alignment, we conclude:\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

The primary reason for the discrepancy between net income and operating cash flow improvement lies in the changes in working capital components.\n\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, the statement is refuted."

Nielsen's time-vested stock options awarded under the 2022 Stock Incentive Plan, which vest over a four-year period (paragraph 83, note (1)).\n\n4. **Purpose of Long-Term Incentive Awards:**\n    - The details provided in paragraph 80 align with the broader compensation philosophy that includes tying executive compensation to long-term stockholder value and ensuring retention through structured vesting periods over multiple years.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the alignment of the compensation strategy with long-term stockholder interests and the structured vesting periods over multiple years, the statement is indeed supported by the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

Whether 11,200,000 shares of Class A Common Stock were issued in 2023.\n\nLet's analyze the document step by step:\n\n1. **Reduction in deferred underwriter fees:**\n\n   Looking at the schedules and tables provided, specifically the \"Schedule of Carrying Amounts and Fair Values of Financial Instruments\" for December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, we do not see any line item explicitly labeled as \"Deferred underwriter fee payable\" for 2023. However, in the 2022 table, there is a \"Deferred underwriter fee payable\" of $1,450,500.\n\n   Additionally, in the \"Consolidated Statements of Parent-Entity Net Investment and Stockholders\u2019 Equity,\" there is an entry for \"Reversal of deferred underwriting cost\" of $900,500 under the year 2023. This matches the amount mentioned in the statement.\n\n2. **Issuance of shares:**\n\n   In the \"Consolidated Statements of Parent-Entity Net Investment and Stockholders\u2019 Equity,\" under the entry for \"PCCU Restructuring\" in 2023, it is noted that 11,200,000 shares of Class A Common Stock were issued. This matches the number of shares mentioned in the statement.\n\nBased on the above analysis:\n\n- There was indeed a $900,500 reduction related to deferred underwriting costs.\n- 11,200,000 shares of Class A Common Stock were issued in 2023.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the statement are supported by the provided financial document.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTherefore, the statement is entailed."

The Company erroneously applied the Section 585 reserve method, whereby it was allowed to, in 1996, change to the specific charge-off method (with no reserve) and recapture the thrift reserves in their entirety if it switched from a thrift charter to a commercial charter prior to 1996. This material weakness resulted in the correction of the material errors and restatement of prior financial statements as disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated audited financial statements contained in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 20, 2023.\"\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the time frame of the material weakness.\n\nThe time frame mentioned in the statement is from 2021 to 2024. However, the provided paragraph only gives a specific date of filing the corrected financial statements for the material weakness, which is September 20, 2023.\n\n**Step 3:** Verify the statement about \"persistent material weakness\" and \"challenging its compliance with financial reporting standards.\"\n\nThe document explicitly states that there was a material weakness due to an erroneous application of Section 585 reserve methods, resulting in the correction of errors and restatement of prior financial statements. This indicates compliance challenges with financial reporting standards.\n\n**Step 4:** Evaluate whether this material weakness persisted from 2021 to 2024.\n\nThe document does not provide direct evidence that the weakness persisted from 2021 to 2024, but it does confirm that it existed up until the corrections were made in 2023.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the information provided, the document confirms a material weakness due to the erroneous application of Section 585 reserve methods. However, there is no explicit evidence to support the specific duration of this weakness from 2021 to 2024. Hence, we can confirm the material weakness and compliance challenges but cannot fully validate the exact time frame.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** based on the lack of explicit confirmation regarding the specific duration of the material weakness from 2021 to 2024."

            " To verify the statement, we need to analyze the provided financial document and focus on the following key points:\n\n1. **Net cash used in financing activities**: The statement mentions a significant increase in net cash used in financing activities due to the repayment of $315.8 million in 2023 Convertible Notes. We need to find information related to this in the document.\n\n2. **Gross profits and operating income in major segments**: The statement mentions higher gross profits and operating income in major segments like Forensic and Litigation Consulting (FLC) and Technology. We need to check the respective segments' gross profits and operating income for 2023 and compare them with the previous year.\n\n3. **Utilization rates**: The statement mentions improved utilization rates as a driver for the increased gross profits and operating income. We need to check if the utilization rates for the respective segments have improved in 2023.\n\n4. **Foreign exchange gains**: The statement mentions foreign exchange gains as another driver for the increased gross profits and operating income. We need to find information related to foreign exchange gains in the document.\n\nLet's go through the document step by step to verify these points.\n\n1. **Net cash used in financing activities**: In paragraph id 262, we can see that the long-term debt, net, has decreased from $315,172 in 2022 to $0 in 2023. This indicates that the company has repaid its long-term debt, which is in line with the statement.\n\n2. **Gross profits and operating income in major segments**:\n\n   - For FLC (paragraph id 196), the gross profit for 2023 is $216,787 (thousands), and for 2022, it is $176,012 (thousands). The operating income for 2023 is $81,296 (thousands), and for 2022, it is $52,693 (thousands). Both gross profit and operating income have increased in 2023 compared to 2022.\n\n   - For Technology (paragraph id 191), the gross profit for 2023 is $431,971 (thousands), and for 2022, it is $380,604 (thousands). The operating income for 2023 is $216,504 (thousands), and for 2022, it is $197,424 (thousands). Both gross profit and operating income have increased in 2023 compared to 2022.\n\n3. **Utilization rates**:\n\n   - For FLC (paragraph id 196), the utilization rate for 2023 is 57%, and for 2022, it is 54%. The utilization rate has improved in 2023 compared to 2022.\n\n   - For Technology (paragraph id 191), the utilization rate for both 2023 and 2022 is 60%. The utilization rate has remained the same in 2023 compared to 2022.\n\n4. **Foreign exchange gains**: The document does not provide direct information about foreign exchange gains. However, the statement mentions that foreign exchange gains are only a partial driver for the increased gross profits and operating income.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the statement is generally accurate, as the document confirms most of the information. The only point that cannot be confirmed is the foreign exchange gains, as the document does not provide direct information about it.\n\nTherefore, the statement is entailed, assuming that the foreign exchange gains mentioned in the statement are not a significant factor in the increase in gross profits and operating income."

Schottenstein and Phillip G. Creek under both Section 302 and Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 underscore their commitment to accuracy and integrity in the financial reports, reflecting robust internal controls over financial reporting.\n\n2. **Examine the Document**:\n   - We need to look for sections of the document that mention certifications made by Robert H. Schottenstein and Phillip G. Creek.\n   - Specifically, we should be looking for references to Section 302 and Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and any comments regarding internal controls over financial reporting.\n\n3. **Relevant Sections**:\n   - **Paragraph id = 152**: Mentions that there were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, their internal control over financial reporting.\n   - **Signature Section**: Mentions Robert H. Schottenstein as the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, but does not specifically mention certifications under Section 302 or Section 906. Moreover, Phillip G. Creek is not mentioned in the provided document.\n\n4. **Direct Evidence**:\n   - The document does not directly state that Robert H. Schottenstein and Phillip G. Creek have made certifications under Section 302 and Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\n   - The document mentions robust internal controls but does not link this directly to certifications by the specific individuals named in the statement.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the provided financial document, there is no direct evidence or mention of certifications made by Robert H. Schottenstein and Phillip G. Creek under Section 302 and Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\n   - Therefore, the statement is not supported by the document.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

The columns for \"Number of Shares Or Units that have not Vested\" and \" Number of Unearned Shares, Units that have not vested\" are both marked with 0.\n\nNow let's examine the statement:\n\n- The statement claims there is a lack of internal alignment between ethical governance and executive compensation due to \"no compensation for executive officers in 2023\". This part is true, as the compensation table shows $0 compensation for both executive officers.\n- The statement also mentions \"the unvested equity awards granted to Mr. Budoi, who transitioned roles\". However, the table shows that Mr. Budoi has no unvested equity awards, as the relevant columns are marked with 0.\n\nTherefore, while the statement is partially true regarding the lack of executive compensation in 2023, it is incorrect about the unvested equity awards for Mr. Budoi.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, the statement is refuted."

There is no explicit mention that these milestones are related to drawdowns on the credit line.\n- The drawdown of $10,000 on the credit line is mentioned separately and is not directly linked to the RSU vesting schedule in the provided document.\n- Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the RSU allocation and vesting schedule are closely integrated with operational financing maneuvers such as credit line drawdowns.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

Consolidated Indebtedness\nIn **paragraph id = 111**, it states:\n```\nThe increase [in interest expense] was driven by higher average outstanding borrowings resulting from indebtedness incurred to fund the acquisition of Kimball International and higher interest rates in 2023 on the Corporation\u2019s variable-rate revolving credit facility.\n```\nThis suggests that the Corporation did incur additional debt to fund the merger, but it does not provide a specific figure of $435.8 million.\n\n### 2. Interest Rate Risks\nIn **paragraph id = 111**, it mentions:\n```\nThe increase [in interest expense] was driven by... higher interest rates in 2023 on the Corporation\u2019s variable-rate revolving credit facility.\n```\nThis indicates that the Corporation is exposed to higher interest rates, which aligns with the statement mentioning heightened interest rate risks.\n\n### 3. Goodwill Amount\nIn **paragraph id = 68**, it states:\n```\nThe Corporation recorded $272.8 million of goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the merger with Kimball International...\n```\nThis confirms the $272.8 million of goodwill added from the merger.\n\n### Analysis and Conclusion\n- **Consolidated Indebtedness**: The document mentions an increase in debt due to the merger but does not specify $435.8 million.\n- **Interest Rate Risks**: The document confirms exposure to higher interest rates, aligning with the statement.\n- **Goodwill Amount**: The document confirms the $272.8 million of goodwill from the merger.\n\nGiven the document does not specify the exact figure of $435.8 million for the increase in consolidated indebtedness, the statement about this specific amount cannot be fully verified. However, the qualitative aspects of increased debt and interest rate risks are supported by the document.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n```\nTherefore, the statement is refuted.\n```"

No mention of data protection regulations or franchise liability.\n\n3. **Paragraph 92:** Mentions risks related to intellectual property protection, including trademarks and trade secrets, but does not address data protection regulations or franchise liability.\n\n4. **Paragraph 97:** Discusses food safety concerns and employee behavior, but does not mention data protection regulations or franchise liability.\n\n5. **Paragraph 103:** Addresses the impact of labor costs and regulatory changes on wages and benefits, but does not discuss data protection regulations or franchise liability.\n\n6. **Paragraph 144:** Specifically mentions the challenge of complying with laws and regulations affecting public companies in the United States. This includes significant additional legal, accounting, and other expenses due to changing laws, regulations, and standards. While it broadly covers regulatory compliance costs, it does not specifically mention data protection regulations or franchise liability.\n\n7. **Paragraph 247 and 250:** Provide details on executive compensation and stock ownership, which are not related to the statement in question.\n\n8. **Consolidated Balance Sheet:** Shows financial data for the years 2023 and 2022 but does not address regulatory or liability concerns.\n\n9. **Paragraph 323:** Discusses the issuance of common stock in settlement of antidilution provisions, not related to the statement in question.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile Paragraph 144 mentions the general challenge of complying with laws and regulations affecting public companies, it does not specifically address data protection regulations such as the CCPA or potential legislative changes in franchise liability. The statement claims that Reborn Inc. faces challenges from these specific areas, but the financial document does not provide explicit support for this claim.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

            " ### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Sections in the Document:**\n   The statement mentions \"deferred tax valuation allowances\" and \"transfer pricing policies.\" We need to look for sections in the financial document that discuss tax-related topics, deferred tax assets, and valuation allowances.\n\n2. **Detect Paragraphs on Deferred Tax Assets:**\n   - Paragraph 271: Consolidated Balance Sheets\n   - Paragraph 322: Fair Value Measurements\n   - Paragraph 345: Net Operating Loss Expiration\n   - Paragraph 381: Compensation Expense\n   - Paragraph 431: Schedule II \u2014 Valuation and Qualifying Accounts\n\n3. **Analysis of Deferred Tax Assets:**\n   - In Paragraph 271 (Consolidated Balance Sheets), specific references to \"Deferred tax assets\" are present. For example:\n\n     ```\n     Deferred tax assets, net $ 1,611 $ 1,501\n     ```\n\n   This indicates that Mannatech has deferred tax assets recognized in their balance sheet.\n\n4. **Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets:**\n   - Paragraph 431 (Schedule II \u2014 Valuation and Qualifying Accounts) provides detailed information on valuation allowances, specifically for deferred tax assets:\n\n     ```\n     Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets $ 9,772\n     ```\n\n     This implies that Mannatech uses valuation allowances for deferred tax assets.\n\n5. **Look for Transfer Pricing Policies:**\n   - Transfer pricing typically involves the allocation of income between different jurisdictions. While direct mention of transfer pricing policies is not found, indirect implications are present in discussions about international operations:\n\n     ```\n     [paragraph id = 144] Risks Related to Our International Operations\n     We currently sell our products in the international markets of Canada, Mexico, Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, ...\n     Our international operations could experience changes in legal and regulatory requirements, ...\n     ```\n\n     This section indicates that Mannatech operates in multiple countries, which usually involves transfer pricing considerations.\n\n6. **Influence on Financial Statements:**\n   - The given statement claims that the determination of deferred tax valuation allowances and transfer pricing policies \"significantly affects Mannatech's financial statements.\" This is supported by the data from the document:\n     - Deferred tax assets are listed under \"Total assets.\"\n     - Tax-related issues (International Operations) can affect income allocation and legal compliance, impacting the financial statements significantly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the specific mention of deferred tax assets and valuation allowances in the financial document and the contextual implications of international operations affecting income allocation, it is clear that these factors considerably impact Mannatech's financial statements. Therefore, the statement is supported by the document.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

Therefore, we cannot directly verify this amount.\n\n#### Segment Reporting Constraints\nThe document does not discuss managing as a single segment or the influence of segment reporting constraints.\n\n#### Three-Year Cumulative Loss Position\n- **2022 Net Loss**: $1,084,000\n- **2023 Net Loss**: $4,154,000\n- **Accumulated Deficit**: $16,773,000 for 2023 and $11,820,000 for 2022\n\nThe three-year cumulative loss position is evident, as the accumulated deficit has increased significantly from 2022 to 2023.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nBased on the provided financial documents, there is no direct evidence to support the specific valuation allowance of $2.6 million against deferred tax assets in 2023. Additionally, the statements do not explicitly discuss segment reporting constraints. However, the three-year cumulative loss position is evident from the reported net losses and accumulated deficits.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **not entailed** by the provided financial document, as the specific details about the valuation allowance and segment reporting constraints are not supported by the data presented.\n\n### Final Determination\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

The occurrence of a reverse capitalization (or reverse recapitalization).\n2. The structuring of deferred payments totaling $56,949,800 to manage liquidity challenges.\n\nLet's analyze the document step by step:\n\n1. **Reverse Capitalization (or Recapitalization)**:\n   - The term \"reverse capitalization\" or \"recapitalization\" appears in the \"CASH FLOWS USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES\" section under \"Proceeds from reverse capitalization, net of transaction costs.\" This confirms that there was a reverse capitalization transaction.\n\n2. **Deferred Payments**:\n   - To find information on deferred payments, we should look in the cash flow statement, specifically under \"CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES\" and \"CASH FLOWS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES,\" and in any tables or notes that mention deferred consideration or similar terms.\n\n   - In the \"Schedule of Change in Deferred Consideration,\" we have different types of deferred payments mentioned:\n     - **Stock consideration**: $2,889,792\n     - **Cash consideration**: $5,650,775 (initial value before adjustments)\n     - **Third Anniversary Consideration Payment**: $810,000\n\n   - However, the table also shows adjustments and issuances that reduce these amounts:\n     - Less: Working capital adjustment: $(108,691)\n     - Less: Issuance of shares and payment to shareholders: $(3,000,000)\n     - Less: Issuance of Abaca warrants: $(1,643,699)\n     - Less: Issuance of third anniversary payment consideration: $(430,000)\n     - Less: Gain recognized in the consolidated statements of operations: $(5,645,107)\n     - Add: Fair value adjustment: $455,933 (stock) + $239,017 (cash) + $380,000 (third anniversary)\n\n   - Total adjustments: $(108,691 + 3,000,000 + 1,643,699 + 430,000 + 5,645,107) + $455,933 + $239,017 + $380,000 = $(9,932,547)\n\n   - Net deferred consideration: $2,889,792 (stock) + $5,650,775 (cash) + $810,000 (third anniversary) - $9,932,547 (adjustments) = $428,020\n\nThe total deferred consideration as of December 31, 2023, is $428,020, not $56,949,800.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe statement asserts that the reverse recapitalization of SHF Holdings Inc. allowed it to manage liquidity challenges by structuring deferred payments totaling $56,949,800.

(Paragraph id=15 and id=89)\n\n2. **Asset Impairments:**\n   - The document mentions that impairment charges for certain retained assets and severance costs related to the sale were recorded as Special charges. (Paragraph id=15)\n\n3. **Fair Value Measurement:**\n   - The document provides information about financial instruments recorded at fair value but does not specify whether any retained assets from the sale were measured using Level 3 inputs. (Paragraph id=21)\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Given Statement\n\nThe statement suggests:\n1. The sale of the Sunoptics prismatic skylights business involved a pre-tax loss of $11.2 million.\n2. Subsequent asset impairments were recorded.\n3. The impairment assessments might have been influenced by Level 3 fair value measurement for retained assets, given the lack of observable market inputs.\n\n### Step 3: Comparing the Statement to the Document\n\n1. **Pre-tax Loss:**\n   - The document confirms that a pre-tax loss of $11.2 million was recognized on the sale of the Sunoptics business.\n\n2. **Asset Impairments:**\n   - The document mentions impairment charges related to the sale, but it does not provide specific details about the fair value measurement level used for retained assets.\n\n3. **Level 3 Fair Value Measurement:**\n   - The document provides a table summarizing balances and the fair value hierarchy level of financial instruments. However, it does not specifically mention Level 3 fair value measurements in relation to the retained assets from the sale of the Sunoptics business.\n\n### Step 4: Final Determination\n\nWhile the document confirms the pre-tax loss and the recording of impairment charges, it does not provide explicit information about the fair value measurement level (Level 3) used for the retained assets. Therefore, the claim about Level 3 fair value measurement influencing impairment assessments is not explicitly supported by the document.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

This could be indicative of the volatility mentioned in the statement.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The financial document supports the notion that the discount rate increase to 5.25% in 2023 may have contributed to volatility in the net periodic pension cost.\n   - The statement's claim about the interest rate risks not being fully offset by the high duration of fixed income investments aligns with the observed changes in the net periodic pension cost.\n\nTherefore, the statement is entailed."

This supports the statement's mention of a substantial shift in notional interest rate swap contracts.\n\n3. **Analyze the strategic purpose:**\n   - The statement mentions that this shift is a strategic hedge against anticipated interest rate fluctuations. Interest rate swap contracts are commonly used to manage interest rate risk, which aligns with the purpose stated.\n   - The document also mentions \"Gain on Derivatives resulted from ... Changes in fair value due to interest rate movements\" (paragraph id = 140). This supports the idea that the company is actively managing interest rate risk.\n\n4. **Evaluate the impact on the MBS portfolio:**\n   - The statement mentions managing duration risk and the impact on their leveraged MBS (Mortgage-Backed Securities) portfolio. While the document does not explicitly state the specific impact on the MBS portfolio, it does mention \"A decline in the value of the MBS pledged as collateral for borrowings under repurchase agreements could result in the counterparties demanding additional collateral pledges or liquidation of some of the existing collateral to reduce borrowing levels\" (paragraph id = 41). This indirectly supports the idea of managing risks associated with the MBS portfolio.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the statement aligns with the information provided in the financial document. The notional amount increase, the purpose of hedging interest rate risk, and the management of risks related to the MBS portfolio are all supported by the document.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTherefore, the statement is entailed."

The reduction could be influenced by multiple factors, including changes in debt levels, interest rates, and other financial strategies.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - While the document acknowledges a 43.9% reduction in interest expense and mentions an interest rate swap, there is no explicit connection made between the reduction and the interest rate swap in the provided excerpts.\n   - Therefore, based on the document, we cannot conclusively establish that the reduction in interest expense is directly attributed to the use of interest rate swaps.\n\n   Therefore, the statement is refuted."

            " To verify the given statement, we need to analyze the provided financial document and identify any information related to the stock repurchase program and insider trading plans. Let's proceed step by step:\n\n1. **Stock Repurchase Program**: The statement mentions a remaining authorization of $256.4 million under a $1.0 billion stock repurchase program as of January 31, 2024. To verify this, we need to look for any mention of a stock repurchase program in the document.\n\n   - The document does not provide any explicit information about a stock repurchase program or its remaining authorization.\n\n2. **Share Repurchases**: The statement claims that the company did not repurchase any shares during the recent fiscal period. To confirm this, we should look for any changes in the number of shares outstanding or any explicit mention of share repurchases.\n\n   - In [paragraph id = 3], the document mentions the \"Issuance of common stock for stock plans, net and employee stock purchase plan\" but does not mention any share repurchases or buybacks.\n   - The \"Number of shares used to compute earnings per share\" changed from 198.4 (basic) and 199.9 (diluted) in 2023 to 198.7 (basic) and 200.2 (diluted) in 2024. This slight increase does not indicate any share repurchases.\n\n3. **Insider Trading Plans**: The statement mentions that no insider trading plans were adopted or terminated. To verify this, we should look for any disclosures related to insider trading plans.\n\n   - The document does not provide any explicit information about insider trading plans.\n\nBased on the provided financial document, we cannot directly confirm the remaining authorization of the stock repurchase program or the lack of insider trading plans, as this information is not explicitly stated. However, we can observe that there were no share repurchases during the recent fiscal period, as the number of shares outstanding slightly increased.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement is not fully entailed or refuted based on the provided document, as it does not contain explicit information about the stock repurchase program or insider trading plans. However, it is consistent with the observation that there were no share repurchases. Therefore, the statement is **not explicitly entailed or refuted** by the available information.\n\n**Final Determination**: Therefore, the statement is **NOT ENTAILED** or refuted due to insufficient explicit information in the document."

However, it provides detailed operating expenses data for 2023 and 2022.\n\n2. **Operating Expenses Analysis:**\n   - **Total Operating Expenses for 2023:** $413,525,203\n   - **Total Operating Expenses for 2022:** $90,428,660\n   - **Change in Operating Expenses:** $323,096,543 (increase)\n   - The document indicates a significant increase in operating expenses from 2022 to 2023, not a reduction.\n\n3. **Impairment of Long-lived Assets:**\n   - The statement mentions an impairment of long-lived assets totaling $65.6 million.\n   - The document confirms this: **Impairment of long-lived assets for 2023:** $65,580,140\n\n4. **Goodwill Impairment:**\n   - The statement mentions a goodwill impairment of $282.2 million.\n   - The document confirms this: **Goodwill impairment for 2023:** $282,173,053\n\n5. **Market Capitalization and Market Efficiency Theory:**\n   - The statement suggests that the impairments were driven by a decline in market capitalization, reflecting the implications of market efficiency theory on asset valuation.\n   - The document does not provide explicit data on market capitalization or directly discuss market efficiency theory. However, impairments are generally driven by reduced asset values, which could be influenced by market conditions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement correctly notes the impairment amounts for long-lived assets and goodwill. However, it incorrectly suggests a reduction in operating expenses by $15 million when the document shows a significant increase. Additionally, while the impairments may reflect a decline in asset values, the document does not explicitly link these to a decline in market capitalization or market efficiency theory.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

            " To verify the statement, we need to assess two key points:\n1. Whether Sotherly Hotels Inc. resumed preferred stock distributions in 2023.\n2. Whether there were outstanding arrears in preferred dividends that prevented the payment of common stock dividends.\n\n**Step 1: Check if preferred stock distributions were resumed in 2023.**\n\nFrom paragraph id = 338, we have the \"Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity\" for Sotherly Hotels Inc. It shows:\n- Preferred stock distributions declared: -$7,977,251 for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThis indicates that preferred stock distributions were indeed made in 2023.\n\n**Step 2: Determine if there were outstanding arrears in preferred dividends.**\n\nFrom paragraph id = 338, we also observe:\n- Dividends and distributions payable were $2,088,160 at the end of 2023.\n\nAdditionally, the notes indicate that there might have been arrears:\n- For Series B Preferred Stock, the per share distribution is listed as $0.500000 for each quarter ended in 2023.\n- For Series C Preferred Stock, the per share distribution is listed as $0.492188 for each quarter ended in 2023.\n- For Series D Preferred Stock, the per share distribution is listed as $0.515625 for each quarter ended in 2023.\n\nGiven that preferred stock distributions were made in 2023 but there are still dividends payable (which could indicate outstanding arrears), it suggests that the distributions might not have cleared all arrears.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the compliance with REIT distribution requirements and redemption complexities.**\n\nREITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders. The document states:\n- \"To maintain qualification as a REIT, the Company is required to make annual distributions to its stockholders of at least 90.0% of our REIT taxable income\" (paragraph id = 258).\n\nThe assertion in the statement is that complexities with preferred dividend arrears could affect compliance with REIT requirements. Since there were still outstanding amounts payable, this would align with the statement's claim about compliance complexities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe financial document supports that preferred stock distributions were made in 2023 and that there were still outstanding arrears in preferred dividends potentially preventing common stock dividends, which impacts compliance with REIT requirements due to the need to address preferred dividend arrears.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

            " To determine whether the statement is entailed or refuted by the given financial document, we need to analyze the specific information provided about lock-up agreements and their potential impact on share value.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Lock-Up Agreements:**\n   - Paragraph [id = 25] states:\n     ```\n     In connection with the transactions, LEW will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause shareholders of LEW who will own more than 15% of the issued and outstanding PubCo Ordinary Shares (an aggregate of 7,241,179 PubCo Ordinary Shares) as of immediately after the Acquisition Merger becoming effective to enter into lock-up agreements. The lock-up agreements provide that these LEW shareholders will not, for at least six (6) months (and in certain cases, up to twelve (12) months) from the closing of the Business Combination and subject to certain exceptions, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any of the ordinary shares issued in connection with the Acquisition Merger, enter into a transaction that would have the same effect, or enter into any swap, hedge or other arrangement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of such shares, whether any of these transactions are to be settled by delivery of any such shares, in cash, or otherwise.\n     ```\n   - This paragraph confirms that there are lock-up agreements for 7,241,179 PubCo Ordinary Shares, restricting the sale of these shares for up to twelve months post-Business Combination.\n\n2. **Potential Impact on Market Value:**\n   - Paragraph [id = 69] states:\n     ```\n     The availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market, after the expiration of these restricted periods, may have an adverse effect on the market price of PubCo Common Stock.\n     ```\n   - This paragraph suggests that the restricted shares becoming available for sale in the public market after the lock-up period may adversely affect the market price of PubCo Ordinary Shares. Although this paragraph does not explicitly mention short-term market pressure, it implies that the availability of a large number of shares can impact the market price.\n\n3. **Short-Term Market Pressure:**\n   - The statement to verify mentions short-term market pressure on PubCo's share value due to limited liquidity. Although the document does not explicitly discuss \"short-term market pressure,\" the context of the lock-up agreements indirectly supports this idea.\n   - Limited liquidity can create short-term market pressure because the market cannot absorb a large number of shares suddenly becoming available without potential downward pressure on the share price.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the provided financial document, the statement about the lock-up agreements restricting 7,241,179 PubCo Ordinary Shares for up to twelve months creating short-term market pressure on PubCo's share value due to limited liquidity is reasonably supported. The document mentions the potential adverse effect on the market price due to the availability of shares after the lock-up period, which indirectly addresses the concern of short-term market pressure.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

Abood, Karrie Willis, and John Stanfield.\n     - This indicates the presence of a structured and effective Board of Directors.\n\n   - **Significant Material Weaknesses in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting:**\n     - The statement refers to restatements and material weaknesses, which implies issues in internal controls and accounting processes.\n     - The document shows evidence of adjustments and corrections in financial statements (paragraph id 313).\n\n3. **Context of Restatements and Weaknesses:**\n\n   - **Adjustments and Restatements:** Paragraph id 313 mentions adjustments and restatements for one particular quarter in 2023.\n   - **Materiality:** The adjustments for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, involved a significant change (greater than 1,345,000) in income related to \"sponsor convertible note \u2013 related party.\"\n\n4. **Immaterial Adjustments for Some Periods, Material for Others:**\n\n   - The context does not provide explicit information on multiple quarters, making it challenging to determine the materiality of restatements across all periods.\n   - The provided restatement for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, is substantial, suggesting that at least for this period, there was a material issue.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, the statement about the restatements and material weaknesses is partially supported:\n\n- The presence of an effective Board of Directors is confirmed.\n- Restatements due to accounting issues, particularly those involving complex financial instruments, are noted.\n- Materiality is explicitly evident for the adjustments in the restated quarter (June 30, 2023).\n\nHowever, the statement's broader claim about restatements for multiple quarters being immaterial or material cannot be fully substantiated without further data for those periods.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed based on the provided document.**"

Diversifying Revenue Streams:\n\n- **Licensing:**\n  - **Paragraph [77]** mentions: \"Allied intends to produce licensable content from the various live events, tournaments, and its own initiatives and brands to sell to viewers worldwide.\"\n  - This indicates Allied's intention to diversify revenue streams through licensing content.\n\n- **Online Platforms:**\n  - **Paragraph [52]** states: \"Allied has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies including its to-be-developed online esports tournament and entertainment subscription platform.\"\n  - This shows Allied's focus on developing online platforms to engage gamers and generate revenue.\n\n#### 2. Managing Risks:\n\n- **Third-Party Operations:**\n  - While the document does not explicitly mention third-party operations, **Paragraph [41]** discusses the importance of \"partnerships with content distributors.\"\n  - **Paragraph [172]** lists \"Deferred revenue,\" which often implies relationships or agreements with third parties like advertisers, sponsors, or distribution partners.\n\n- **Global Regulations:**\n  - Though the document does not explicitly mention global regulations, **Paragraph [37]** highlights operational risks and challenges in the rapidly developing industry, implicitly requiring a robust risk management framework to navigate these challenges.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the document:\n\n1. **Allied's focus on diversifying revenue streams through licensing and online platforms:**\n   - This is entailed by paragraphs [77] and [52], which discuss Allied's plans to develop licensable content and online platforms.\n\n2. **The necessity to manage risks associated with third-party operations and global regulations:**\n   - This is supported by mentions of operational risks and the need for partnerships. While not explicitly stating third-party operations and global regulations, the context and challenges described suggest the necessity for a robust risk management framework.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Controlled Company Status**: The statement mentions that Corsair Gaming is a controlled company. We need to find information in the document that confirms or denies this status.\n\n   - The document does not explicitly state that Corsair Gaming is a controlled company. However, it does mention \"we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence\" if internal controls are not certified or attested to. This implies the company is publicly traded, but we need more specific information about its controlled status.\n\n2. **Nasdaq Exemptions**: The statement suggests that Corsair Gaming relies on Nasdaq exemptions. We should look for any mention of exemptions or special considerations related to Nasdaq rules.\n\n   - There is no explicit mention of Nasdaq exemptions in the provided text.\n\n3. **Ownership Structure and Market Dynamics**: The statement highlights potential risks associated with ownership structure and market dynamics. We need to look for information regarding significant shareholders, market fluctuations, or other related disclosures.\n\n   - The document does not provide direct details about the ownership structure, such as major shareholders or their percentage of ownership. However, it mentions risks related to the company's reputation and public confidence, which could indirectly affect stock price volatility.\n\n4. **Risk Factors**: The statement concludes by mentioning risk factors for investors. We should identify any risk factors discussed in the document.\n\n   - The document discusses various risks, including those related to reputation, product quality, regulatory changes, technological developments, and competition. However, these are general risks and not specifically tied to the company's controlled status or Nasdaq exemptions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe provided financial document does not explicitly support the statement about Corsair Gaming being a controlled company relying on Nasdaq exemptions. Additionally, it does not provide specific details about the ownership structure or market dynamics that would directly link to increased stock price volatility affecting risk factors for investors.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

From paragraph 114, it is identified that the valuation allowance increased significantly from $3,583 in 2022 to $7,011 in 2023, implying that management assesses a lower probability of utilizing deferred tax assets due to insufficient future taxable income. \n2. Paragraph 115 supports this increase in the valuation allowance with data points showing the additive effect leading to the end-of-year balance. \n3. The concept of lease accounting, relevant in paragraph 112, indicates that the company's right-of-use liabilities sit at $138 as of December 31, 2023. A high lease liability and a short weighted-average remaining lease term of 0.9 years, alongside a discount rate of 8%, suggest an aggressive leasing strategy that may stress cash flow and affect future taxable income.\n4. Combining these elements suggests that the increase in valuation allowance reflects financial strain, further complicated by the company's lease commitments. The use of lease accounting principles helps integrate understanding of lease-related liabilities' impact on cash flow and tax strategy.",

            " To determine whether the given statement is entailed or refuted by the provided financial document, we need to analyze the document, focusing on relevant financial data related to changes in the Net Asset Value (NAV) and the impact of gold sales.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Net Asset Value (NAV) and Fair Value of Gold Holdings:**\n   - On December 31, 2023, the fair value of the investment in gold is $57,869,843. (Paragraph 1)\n   - On March 31, 2023, the fair value of the investment in gold is $113,871,350. (Paragraph 1)\n\n   This indicates a significant drop in the fair value of gold holdings from March 31, 2023, to December 31, 2023.\n\n2. **Net Investment Loss:**\n   - For the nine months ended December 31, 2023, the net investment loss is $(89,459). (Paragraph 3)\n\n3. **Realized Gains from Gold Sales:**\n   - For the nine months ended December 31, 2023, the net realized gain from gold distributed for the redemption of shares and sold to pay expenses is $4,786,535. (Paragraph 3)\n\n4. **Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets:**\n   - For the nine months ended December 31, 2023, the net increase in net assets resulting from operations is $1,885,023. (Paragraph 3)\n\n5. **NAV Per Share:**\n   - On December 31, 2023, the NAV per share is $27.55. (Paragraph 1)\n   - On March 31, 2023, the NAV per share is $26.48. (Paragraph 1)\n\n   This indicates a slight increase in the NAV per share despite the drop in the fair value of gold holdings.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe financial document shows a significant reduction in the fair value of gold holdings, which aligns with the first part of the statement. Additionally, the realized gains from gold sales did help offset some of the net investment losses, which aligns with the second part of the statement.\n\nTherefore, the statement is entailed by the provided financial document.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

However, they do mention material estimates related to the determination of the allowance for credit losses, valuation of deferred tax assets, and fair value of financial assets and liabilities.\n- There is no specific indication of improper maintenance of a deferred tax liability mentioned in the document.\n\n**Non-Performing Loans:**\n- The consolidated balance sheet lists various assets, including loans, but does not explicitly label non-performing loans. Typically, non-performing loans would be listed under assets or within footnotes detailing allowances for loan losses.\n- The notes do not specifically mention non-performing loans. However, they mention an allowance for credit losses related to loans.\n\n### Specific Analysis from the Document\n\n- **Note 1 (Basis of Presentation):** There is no explicit mention of internal control weaknesses or issues with deferred tax liabilities.\n- **Note 9 (Recent Accounting Pronouncements):** Discusses recent accounting standards but does not address internal control weaknesses.\n- **Balance Sheet:**\n  - Loans, net of allowance of $1,890,855 and $2,158,590, respectively, are mentioned but do not specify non-performing loans.\n  - Deferred tax assets are mentioned but without details on any improper maintenance.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the lack of explicit mention of internal control weaknesses related to the improper maintenance of a deferred tax liability and no specific reference to non-performing loans being zero, the statement cannot be supported by the document.

The initial measurement on January 10, 2023, was $430,021.

This connection requires validation based on the information provided in the financial document.\n\nParagraph 118 specifically states the Company's plans and efforts to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605 within the Cure Period.\n\nThe change in fair value of the Forward Purchase Agreement amounts to $235,095, and the amount received from the Series B Capital Raise is $254,269. However, the document does not clearly specify a direct correlation between these figures and the Company's ability to regain Nasdaq compliance. It only mentions that the Company is actively engaged in efforts to regain compliance by the specified Cure Period.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven that the document does not establish a direct relationship between the $235,095 increase in the fair value of the Forward Purchase Agreement or the $254,269 from the Series B Capital Raise and the Company's ability to regain Nasdaq compliance, the statement is not explicitly supported by the provided financial document.

Manheim's appointment, his experience, and the independence requirements of the audit committee members according to NYSE standards.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Finding Information about Paul M. Manheim:**\n   - The document includes compensation data for the directors for 2023, where Paul M. Manheim is listed, indicating he was a director during this period (paragraph id = 416).\n   - The document mentions \"Mr. Novelly recently retired as chairman and chief executive officer of Apex Oil Company, Inc.\" It does not explicitly mention Paul M. Manheim's roles or experiences in audit committees outside of FutureFuel Corp.\n\n2. **Independence Requirements of Audit Committee Members:**\n   - According to NYSE standards, all members of an audit committee must be independent.\n   - We do not have explicit information in the document regarding the independence of the audit committee members, including Paul M. Manheim.\n\n3. **Commitment to Strong Governance:**\n   - The statement mentions that Paul M. Manheim's appointment underscores the company's commitment to strong governance, but the document does not provide explicit details about his appointment or how it relates to strong governance.\n\n### Relevant Data from the Document:\n- **Directors' Compensation (paragraph id = 416):**\n  - Paul M. Manheim is listed among the directors, but there is no specific mention of him being the audit committee chair.\n\n- **Business Experience (paragraph id = 359):**\n  - The document details Paul A. Novelly's extensive experience but does not provide similar information for Paul M. Manheim.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe document does not provide explicit information about Paul M. Manheim's appointment as the audit committee chair, his experience as an audit committee chair elsewhere, or the independence requirements of the audit committee members at FutureFuel Corp. Therefore, the statement cannot be supported by the provided document.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

These businesses generated annual revenue of approximately $66 million in 2022, primarily in the Data Solutions segment.\n\n2. **Realignment:**\n   - The document does not explicitly mention a strategic realignment towards becoming a modern payments and data company.\n\n3. **North Star Program:**\n   - Paragraph [id=342] discusses the North Star program, highlighting its goals to drive shareholder value by expanding EBITDA growth, increasing cash flow, paying down debt, and improving the leverage ratio. It mentions a focus on structural cost reductions and revenue growth.\n\n### Step 3: Cross-Reference the Financial Document with the Statement\n1. **Divestitures:**\n   - The document confirms the divestitures in the web hosting and logo design businesses in June 2023.\n\n2. **Realignment:**\n   - There is no direct mention of a strategic realignment towards becoming a modern payments and data company. The document describes cost reductions and efficiency improvements but does not explicitly link these to a realignment towards a specific industry focus.\n\n3. **North Star Program:**\n   - The document mentions the North Star program and its objectives, including increasing cash flow, but it does not specify a $100 million improvement in free cash flow by 2026.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, the statement is partially supported by the financial document. While the divestitures and the North Star program are mentioned, the specific target of a $100 million improvement in free cash flow by 2026 and the strategic realignment towards becoming a modern payments and data company are not explicitly confirmed in the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed** regarding the divestitures and the existence of the North Star program, but **refuted** regarding the specific targets and the strategic realignment.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

The balance sheet and other provided financial statements do not directly mention this amount.\n   - **Obligor Group 1 Net Loss**:\n     - According to the \"Summarized Statements of Earnings\" section:\n       ```\n       Three months ended March 31, 2024\n       Obligor group 1\n       Net earnings (loss) attributable to Trane Technologies plc $ (121.8)\n       ```\n\n4. **Evaluate the Statement**:\n   - **Intercompany Payables**: The financial document does not support or mention intercompany payables of $5,692.7 million.\n   - **Obligor Group 1 Net Loss**: The document confirms that Obligor Group 1 recorded a net loss attributable to Trane Technologies plc of $121.8 million.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the document does not contain any information about intercompany payables totaling $5,692.7 million, the statement about significant intercompany payables cannot be validated.\n   - However, the net loss attributable to Trane Technologies plc for Obligor Group 1 is accurately stated in the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted because the document does not support the claim about significant intercompany payables of $5,692.7 million.

This loss, combined with the intangible asset impairment, contributes to a significant loss from operations.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the statement that Aclaris Therapeutics recorded a revaluation gain of $26.9 million on its contingent consideration in 2023 is incorrect. The document indicates a revaluation loss, which, along with the intangible asset impairment, negatively impacts the loss from operations. This contradicts the information provided in the statement.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

Let's proceed methodically:\n\n1. **Understand Key Sections**:\n   - Review sections that discuss business combinations, shareholder voting power, and the issuance of new shares.\n   - Look for any details about how business combinations might impact shareholder voting power.\n\n2. **Review Relevant Paragraphs**:\n   - Paragraph 22 discusses various factors related to financial conditions, but does not directly mention voting power.\n   - Paragraph 29 touches on the complexities of multiple business combinations simultaneously, but not voting power.\n   - Paragraph 30 addresses the evaluation of the management team but does not discuss changes in voting power.\n   - Paragraph 42 about automatic liquidation focuses on the timeframe for a business combination but does not delve into voting power issues.\n   - Paragraph 49 mentions various impacts and obligations post-business combination but does not touch on the specifics of voting power.\n   - Similar reviews need to be done for paragraphs 170, 178, 180, 183, and 200 as they contain primarily detailed financial data and conditions, but no direct mention of voting power outcomes.\n\n3. **Key Paragraph Insight Missing**:\n   - None of the specifically referenced paragraphs contain information about how the outcome of a business combination might lead to shareholders having less than 50% of voting power due to the issuance of new shares.\n\n4. **Concluding**:\n   - Since none of the provided paragraphs discuss the dynamics where original shareholders might end up with less than 50% voting power post-transaction due to new share issuance, there is no basis to entail this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted because the provided financial document does not contain information supporting the scenario described.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

            " To verify the given statement, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Sections:**\n   - We need to locate parts of the document that discuss the adjustment to the conversion price of the December 2020 Convertible Notes.\n   - We also need to find sections that discuss the repricing of warrants and the concept of deemed dividends.\n\n2. **Analyze the Document:**\n   - Review paragraph [id = 50] which discusses the reduction of the conversion price.\n   - Check for any connection to paragraphs that mention deemed dividends (e.g., paragraph [id = 2] and related sections related to warrant activity).\n\n3. **Document Each Step:**\n   - Review the details of the conversion price change.\n   - Identify any indicated impact or lack thereof regarding the conversion price change.\n   - Analyze the deemed dividends and how they relate to the adjustment.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### Conversion Price Change:\n- **Paragraph [id = 50]:** This paragraph discusses the reduction of the conversion price from $0.03 per share to $0.01 per share for the December 2020 $700,000 6% Convertible Notes. It explicitly states:\n  > \"On November 13, 2023, the Company reduced the conversion rate from $0.03 cents per share to $0.01 cent per share through December 31, 2023. The Company reviewed the reduction of the conversion price and deemed that it did not meet the criterion for debt extinguishment.\"\n\n#### Deemed Dividends and Warrants:\n- **Paragraph [id = 2]** (Table and Underlying Documentation): This section mentions \"Deemed dividend\" indicating $269,218 for the nine months ended December 31, 2023. This figure could be related to the repricing impact.\n- No direct reference is made here on how the deemed dividends specifically tie to the repricing of the notes.\n\n#### Warrant Activity:\n- **Paragraph [id = 45]**: This discusses initial issuance and nature of warrants with $0.60 exercise price.\n- **Paragraph [id = 57]**: Tracks outstanding and exercisable nonemployee options (which may include warrants) showing an increase from 6,483,000 to 14,483,000 but does not specifically detail repricing and direct effect into deemed dividends.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement provided claims a strategic repricing of over 92 million warrants resulting in a combined impact recognized as deemed dividends to shareholders due to the conversion price reduction. However, the document provided here:\n- Indicates a straight conversion price reduction from $0.03 to $0.01 without detailing any direct repricing of warrants related specifically to them deemed dividends.\n- The key financial table [id = 2] though mentions deemed dividends, it does not directly attribute to strategic repricing as noticed here.\n\nTherefore, the given statement is disputed because the document neither adequately links the conversion price adjustment to the repricing of specific warrants nor clearly ties this reduction directly to the deemed dividends as recognized.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

Rule 13a-14(a)/15d-14(a) certifications were signed by key executives.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Omnibus Incentive Plan Adherence to SEC Guidelines:**\n   - The document mentions the \"Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan\" repeatedly in several sections. For example:\n     - Paragraph 69: References to the 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan and its forms.\n   - This indicates the existence of the plan but does not explicitly detail its adherence to SEC guidelines. However, since it is repeatedly mentioned across official filings, it implies that it follows necessary regulations.\n\n2. **Performance-Based Stock Units for Officers:**\n   - The document mentions specific forms related to performance-based stock units under the 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan:\n     - Paragraph 69: Includes \"Form of Performance-based Restricted Stock Units Award Agreement under the Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan.\"\n   - This directly supports the existence of performance-based stock units for officers.\n\n3. **Rule 13a-14(a)/15d-14(a) Certifications Signed by Key Executives:**\n   - The document contains certifications:\n     - Paragraph 70: Lists Rule 13a-14(a)/15d-14(a) certifications.\n     - These certifications are signed by Gregory B. Maffei (Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer) and Brian J. Wendling (Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Principal Financial Officer, and Principal Accounting Officer).\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the provided document, the statement is supported by the evidence presented:\n\n- The existence and mention of the 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan in official filings suggest adherence to SEC guidelines.\n- There is explicit mention of performance-based stock units for officers.\n- Rule 13a-14(a)/15d-14(a) certifications are listed and signed by key executives.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

            " To determine if the statement is entailed or refuted, we need to examine the financial data provided regarding Loop Industries' intangible assets.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Locate the relevant financial data:**\n   - In the \"Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets,\" we see intangible assets listed under \"Non-current assets\" for both November 30, 2023, and February 28, 2023.\n\n2. **Extract the relevant figures:**\n   - Intangible assets, net as of November 30, 2023: $1,485\n   - Intangible assets, net as of February 28, 2023: $1,210\n\n3. **Calculate the change in intangible assets:**\n   - The change in intangible assets from February 28, 2023, to November 30, 2023, is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Change in intangible assets} = \\text{November 30, 2023 value} - \\text{February 28, 2023 value}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Change in intangible assets} = 1,485 - 1,210 = 275\n     \\]\n\n4. **Compare with the statement:**\n   - The statement claims an increase to $1,585 by November 2023 with no impairment losses. Let's see if this is accurate or not.\n\n5. **Evaluate the statement's accuracy:**\n   - From the provided document, the intangible assets increased by $275 to $1,485, not $1,585. Additionally, we do not have information about impairment losses directly from the data, but based on the numbers provided, there is a clear discrepancy.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the documented figures, Loop Industries reported an increase in intangible assets to $1,485, not $1,585. This is a significant difference and clearly refutes the statement.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

This contradicts the claim of owning all major communities.\n\n2. **Risks Associated with Leases**:\n   - The document highlights risks associated with these leases: \"If we are found to be in breach of a lease, we could lose the right to use the property. In addition, unless we can extend the terms of these leases before their expiration, as to which no assurance can be given, we will lose our right to operate our facilities located on these properties upon expiration of the leases.\" This indicates potential operational risks related to leases.\n\n3. **Long-Term Supply Contracts**:\n   - The document discusses reliance on supply contracts: \"We selectively pursue opportunities to expand existing communities and develop new communities to satisfy customer demand. We employ rigorous discipline to our capital expenditures to grow our business. Our investment strategy is generally to only deploy new capital with visibility\u2014typically a contract\u2014to revenue and returns.\" While this suggests a disciplined approach, there is no explicit mention of how these contracts ensure financial stability during global economic downturns.\n\n4. **Operational Risks**:\n   - The document lists various operational risks, including:\n     - \"Bankruptcy or insolvency of our customers, thereby reducing demand for our services.\"\n     - \"Political and economic instability; federal government budgeting and appropriations; enforcement of remedies in various jurisdictions.\"\n     - \"Competition as a provider of specialty rental and hospitality services.\"\n   - These risks indicate that operational risks are not minimized by the ownership of communities or reliance on contracts.\n\n5. **Financial Stability**:\n   - The document mentions financial policies and liquidity: \"The Company\u2019s disciplined financial approach also allows it to maintain sufficient liquidity and to reduce refinancing risk, with the nearest significant debt maturity of $181.4 million occurring in June 2025 consisting of our approximately $181.4 million in aggregate principal amount of 10.75% senior secured notes due June 15, 2025 (the \u201c2025 Senior Secured Notes\u201d). The Company had total liquidity of approximately $278.9 million as of December 31, 2023.\"\n   - While this indicates financial planning, it does not directly link to minimizing operational risks through ownership of communities and long-term supply contracts.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement that \"The ownership of all major communities and reliance on long-term supply contracts minimize operational risks, ensuring financial stability even during global economic downturns\" is refuted by the financial document. The document highlights ownership risks related to leases and various operational risks that are not mitigated by ownership or contracts. Therefore, the statement is **refuted**."

The values are (-48.9%) for 2023 and (-46.2%) for 2022. A negative value here might indicate that a valuation allowance was eliminated or reduced.\n\n2. **State R&D credits**: In the same paragraph (id = 133), there's a mention of \"State R&D Credits\" with values of 2.9% for 2023 and 0.0% for 2022. This confirms that the company had state R&D credits in 2023.\n\n3. **Net deferred tax assets**: In the \"Consolidated Balance Sheets\" (paragraph id = 91), we can see that the company has a \"Deferred tax assets\" line. The values are $ - for 2023 and $691 for 2022 (in thousands). This seems to contradict the statement, as the deferred tax assets decreased rather than being around $2.6 million.\n\n4. **Confidence in future taxable income realization**: There's no direct mention of the company's confidence in future taxable income realization in the provided document. However, the elimination or reduction of a valuation allowance typically signals that a company is confident in realizing its deferred tax assets in the future.\n\nBased on the provided document, we can conclude the following:\n- Psychemedics Corporation had state R&D credits in 2023.\n- The company might have eliminated or reduced its valuation allowance in 2023, as indicated by the negative change in valuation reserve.\n- However, the deferred tax assets did not increase to approximately $2.6 million; instead, they decreased.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** based on the information available in the provided financial document. The deferred tax assets did not increase to approximately $2.6 million, and there's no explicit mention of the company's confidence in future taxable income realization."

A proper understanding of revenue recognition principles, specifically Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 980-340 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, necessitates that revenue can't be recognized unless the utility has been legally granted the authority to do so.\n4.

            " To verify the statement, we need to analyze the financial document to find relevant information regarding SCE's credit risk exposure and the wildfire-related revenue recognition.\n\n1. **Credit Risk Exposure**:\n   - The statement mentions a potential $1.23 million collateral requirement for financial hedging activities if market prices move unfavorably. However, there is no direct mention of this specific amount in the provided financial document. Therefore, we cannot directly confirm the credit risk exposure figure.\n\n2. **Wildfire-related Revenue Recognition**:\n   - The statement claims that SCE seeks to recognize $191 million in wildfire-related revenue. In paragraph id = 14, the document mentions: \"In April 2024, the CPUC issued a proposed decision which, if adopted, would approve the recovery of SCE's capital request of $312 million and operation and maintenance expenses of $200 million, resulting in a revenue requirement of $191 million plus ongoing capital-related revenue requirements.\"\n   - This directly supports the claim that SCE is seeking to recognize $191 million in wildfire-related revenue, which is subject to approval by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).\n\nBased on the provided financial document, while the specific credit risk exposure amount is not mentioned, the wildfire-related revenue recognition is clearly stated.\n\n**Conclusion**: Since the document does not provide specific information on the credit risk exposure, we cannot confirm that part of the statement. However, the wildfire-related revenue recognition is accurately reflected in the document. Therefore, the statement is partially supported but not fully confirmed due to the lack of information on credit risk exposure.\n\nThus, the statement is **refuted** based on the lack of confirmation of the credit risk exposure amount."

            " To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to analyze the relevant financial data provided in the document. Specifically, we need to check the following points:\n\n1. If Houlihan Lokey recognized an excess tax benefit during the three months ended December 31, 2023.\n2. If there was a significant growth in net income compared to the previous period.\n3. If there were adjustments in share-based compensation expense that could have influenced the effective tax rate.\n\nLet's proceed with the analysis:\n\n### 1. Excess Tax Benefit\nThe statement mentions an \"excess tax benefit.\" In financial terms, an excess tax benefit usually refers to a situation where the accounting tax expense recognized is lower than the actual tax paid, which could be due to various reasons such as tax credits, prior-period adjustments, or changes in tax laws. However, the document does not explicitly mention an \"excess tax benefit.\" Instead, it provides the provision for income taxes.\n\nFrom the \"Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income,\" we see the following:\n- Provision for income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2023: $31,772\n- Provision for income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2022: $20,559\n\nThe increase in the provision for income taxes from $20,559 to $31,772 indicates a higher tax expense for the period, which does not support the statement about an \"excess tax benefit.\"\n\n### 2. Net Income Growth\nTo determine if there was significant net income growth, we need to compare the net income for the three months ended December 31, 2023, with the same period in 2022.\n\nFrom the \"Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income,\" we see the following:\n- Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2023: $70,803\n- Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2022: $63,051\n\nThe net income increased from $63,051 to $70,803, which is a growth of approximately 12%. This supports the statement that there was significant net income growth.\n\n### 3. Adjustments in Share-Based Compensation Expense\nThe document does not provide direct information on share-based compensation expense or its adjustments. However, we can infer some information from the notes on activity in liability-classified share awards.\n\nFrom the \"Activity in liability-classified share awards,\" we see the following:\n- Balance as of December 31, 2023: $14,890\n- Balance as of December 31, 2022: $13,592\n\nThe increase in the balance from $13,592 to $14,890 suggests that there were additional share awards granted during the period. However, without specific details on the share-based compensation expense and its impact on the effective tax rate, we cannot definitively conclude that adjustments in share-based compensation expense influenced the effective tax rate.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, the statement that Houlihan Lokey achieved significant net income growth is supported by the data. However, the statement about recognizing an excess tax benefit is not supported by the provided financial document, as the provision for income taxes increased. Additionally, there is no clear evidence of adjustments in share-based compensation expense influencing the effective tax rate.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

While this decline in revenue is considered temporary, it has adversely impacted the Company\u2019s liquidity in the short term, within the North America segment.

Paragraph 61 describes the exposure to interest rate risks related to TripCo's borrowing activities, indicating that they may use financial instruments to balance fixed and variable rate debts as a risk management strategy.\n4. Paragraph 62 shows that Tripadvisor's convertible senior notes are an essential part of the debt structure with fixed rates, while equity method accounting must be used for TripCo's 21% economic interest in Tripadvisor, potentially affecting financial reporting and capital structure management.\n5. The statement incorrectly suggests that TripCo's strategy is straightforward, which overlooks the complexity of their exposure to interest rate fluctuations and the need for a mix of debt management strategies. Furthermore, relying solely on the equity method of accounting for its 57% voting interest is incorrect because economic interest, not voting interest, determines the application of the equity method.",

            " To assess the truthfulness of the given statement, we need to analyze specific details about the company's interest rate cap, the Term Loan, and the impact of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) changes on the company's interest expenses. We will proceed by examining the relevant information from the provided financial document.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Interest Rate Cap Details (Paragraph ID 31)**:\n   - The company has an interest rate cap contract (\"Cap\") that began in December 2021.\n   - The Cap manages the company\u2019s exposure to interest rate movements on a portion of the Term Loan through November 2026.\n   - The Cap provides the company with the right to receive payment if one-month SOFR exceeds 1.436%.\n   - The Cap has a notional amount of $1.0 billion.\n\n2. **Interest Expense Due to SOFR Fluctuations (Paragraph ID 119)**:\n   - The document states that due to the interest rate rising from the floor (0.75%) to the Cap level (1.436%), the company expects its annual interest expense to increase by approximately $12.0 million, or approximately $3.0 million per quarter.\n   - For every SOFR increase of 25 basis points above the Cap level, the company expects its annual interest expense to increase by an additional $1.6 million related to the unhedged portion of the Term Loan.\n\n3. **Statement Analysis**:\n   - The statement claims: \"The company's effective use of the interest rate Cap on its Term Loan has limited the increase in annual interest expenses to only $1.6 million per quarter, despite the rising SOFR rate which increased interest expenses for unhedged portions by $3 million for every 25 basis point increase.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the provided document:\n- The Cap effectively limits the interest rate exposure by paying the company if SOFR exceeds 1.436%, but this specific effect is not directly quantified to $1.6 million per quarter in the document.\n- The document explicitly states that, with SOFR increasing from the floor to the Cap level, the expected increase in annual interest expense is $12.0 million or $3.0 million per quarter.\n- For further SOFR increases above the Cap level, additional expected increases are $1.6 million annually or roughly $0.4 million quarterly for each 25 basis point increase.\n\nThe statement is partially correct in mentioning an increase related to SOFR changes but misrepresents the Cap's effect by combining different impacts. Therefore, the statement is not accurately supported by the document.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

Let's break this down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Read the Context and the Statement\nThe document provides detailed financial information about Trane Technologies PLC, including balance sheets, details of corporate restructuring, deconsolidation, and liquidity measures. The statement to verify is:\n\"Despite the deconsolidation of Aldrich and Murray in their bankruptcy proceedings, the Company disclosed a fair value retention of $270.0 million in equity as per ASC 820, while establishing a Qualified Settlement Fund under IRS Section 468B to address liabilities.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Document for Relevant Information\nFrom the document:\n- **Paragraph 77**: Upon deconsolidation in 2020, the Company recorded its retained interest in Aldrich and Murray at fair value within Other noncurrent assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n  - \"the Company recorded an aggregate equity investment of $53.6 million as of the Petition Date.\"\n- **Paragraph 83**: Details about funding the Qualified Settlement Fund (QSF).\n  - \"resulting in an operating cash outflow of $270.0 million in the Company\u2019s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, of which $91.8 million was allocated to continuing operations and $178.2 million was allocated to discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2022.\"\n- **Paragraph 136**: Additional information about the QSF.\n  - \"On January 27, 2022, the Bankruptcy Court granted the request to fund the QSF, which was funded on March 2, 2022.\"\n\n### Step 3: Document the Reasoning Process\n- The statement mentions a fair value retention of $270.0 million in equity, which is not supported by the document. Paragraph 77 indicates that the Company recorded an aggregate equity investment of $53.6 million as of the Petition Date, not $270.0 million.\n- The document confirms the establishment of a Qualified Settlement Fund (QSF) with a funding value of $270.0 million, as mentioned in Paragraphs 83 and 136.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nBased on the provided document, the Company recorded an equity investment of $53.6 million, not $270.0 million. Therefore, the statement about a fair value retention of $270.0 million in equity is not supported by the document. The establishment of the QSF with $270.0 million is accurate.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

Here are the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Statement\nThe statement claims significant redemptions totaling $100,000,000 in March and December 2023, ongoing SPAC expenses, and dependence on external financing or successful mergers due to only $40,000,000 remaining in the Trust Account, limiting internal funding for future business combinations.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Relevant Financial Data\nWe need to find information related to redemptions and the balance in the Trust Account.\n\n### Step 3: Examine Redemptions\nAccording to the statement, there were significant redemptions totaling $100,000,000 in March and December 2023. We need to locate this information in the document.\n\n**Financial Document Analysis:**\n- **Paragraph [116]:**\n  - Mentioned redemptions:\n    - Stockholder redemption of 7,391,973 shares at redemption value: $76,054,240\n    - Stockholder redemption of 1,363,378 shares at redemption value: $14,619,421\n  - Total redemption amount: $76,054,240 + $14,619,421 = $90,673,661\n\n### Step 4: Examine Trust Account Balance\nThe statement mentions a Trust Account balance of $40,000,000 after redemptions.\n\n**Financial Document Analysis:**\n- **Paragraph [104]:**\n  - Investments held in Trust Account at December 31, 2023: $29,718,024\n  - Investments held in Trust Account at December 31, 2022: $117,724,476\n\n### Step 5: Compare Financial Data with the Statement\n**Redemptions:**\n- The document shows redemptions totaling $90,673,661, not $100,000,000 as stated.\n\n**Trust Account Balance:**\n- The document shows a Trust Account balance of $29,718,024 at December 31, 2023, not $40,000,000 as stated.\n\n### Step 6: Analyze Conclusion Based on Financial Document\nBased on the provided financial document:\n1. The total redemptions mentioned were $90,673,661, not $100,000,000.\n2. The balance in the Trust Account at December 31, 2023, was $29,718,024, not $40,000,000.\n\nTherefore, the statement claiming $100,000,000 in redemptions and a Trust Account balance of $40,000,000 is not accurate based on the provided financial document. The actual redemptions were less, and the Trust Account balance was also lower.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

There are mentions of unexercised options but no other stock awards or incentive plan awards are listed.\n\n3. **Review of Governance**\n   - **Omnibus Incentive Plan (Paragraph [395])**:\n     - The plan aims to encourage ownership by key personnel, aligning their interests with those of the shareholders, and providing incentives to promote the company's success.\n\n4. **Review of Stock Options**\n   - **Equity Incentive Plan Awards (Paragraph [417])**:\n     - The table lists the unexercised options for directors, indicating that stock options are a part of the compensation structure.\n\n5. **Alignment with Agency Theory and Stakeholder Theory**\n   - **Agency Theory**:\n     - The compensation structure, including stock options, aims to align the interests of executives and directors with those of the shareholders, reducing agency problems.\n   - **Stakeholder Theory**:\n     - The document does not explicitly address the balancing of stakeholder interests beyond shareholders. However, the focus on operational efficiency, cost control, and environmental protection in the future strategy (Paragraph [48]) indirectly suggests consideration for various stakeholders.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe statement mentions that directors are tasked with balancing executive incentives solely through stock options. However, the provided document shows a broader compensation structure that includes salaries, bonuses, and other forms of compensation, not just stock options. While stock options are a part of the compensation, they are not the sole component.\n\nFurthermore, the document discusses a more comprehensive approach to aligning executive incentives with shareholder interests through the Omnibus Incentive Plan, which includes encouraging ownership, long-term employment, and the promotion of the company's success.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

Such prior events have not had a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. In addition, the amount of insurance coverage the Company maintains may be inadequate or difficult to obtain in order to cover claims or liabilities relating to a cybersecurity attack.\"\n\n### Step 3: Document Each Step of the Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Sections:**\n   - Paragraph 77 explicitly mentions cybersecurity threats and insurance coverage.\n\n2. **Interpret the Statements:**\n   - The company has experienced cybersecurity threats.\n   - These events have not had a material impact on the company's financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.\n   - The company maintains insurance coverage, but it is mentioned that this coverage may be inadequate or difficult to obtain.\n\n3. **Compare with the Statement:**\n   - The statement claims the company has comprehensive insurance coverage to address potential liabilities from future severe cyber incidents.\n   - However, Paragraph 77 indicates uncertainty about the adequacy of this insurance coverage, suggesting it may not fully cover liabilities from a severe cybersecurity attack.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nThe document implies that while the company has insurance, there is uncertainty regarding whether this insurance is comprehensive enough to cover all potential liabilities from future severe cyber incidents. Therefore, the statement's assertion of comprehensive coverage ensuring financial stability without the need for additional contingency planning contradicts the information provided in the document.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

Let's go through this step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Understand the CECL Model and ASC 326**:\n   - According to the document, Versus Systems Inc. applies the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model under ASC 326. This model requires recognizing allowances for credit losses based on expected losses over the life of the asset.\n   - The statement mentions that the CECL model is applied to financial assets at fair value, which could impact impairment reversals.\n\n2. **Review Accounts Receivable Data**:\n   - The document shows accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses, decreased from $60,749 in 2022 to $18,222 in 2023. (Referenced in the Consolidated Balance Sheets section)\n\n3. **Assess Impairment Reversal**:\n   - The document does not explicitly mention any impairment reversals related to accounts receivable. However, it does state that \"if the credit risk of a financial asset decreases in a subsequent period, any previously recognized impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss, limited to the extent that the carrying amount does not exceed what the amortized cost would have been had the impairment not been recognized.\"\n\n4. **Analyze Relevant Notes and Model Application**:\n   - The document mentions that Versus Systems Inc. applies the CECL model under ASC 326 for impairment of financial assets. This implies that the company follows the requirements specified by ASC 326.\n   - No explicit reference mentions impairment reversals in accounts receivable in the context of fair value or specific decrease in credit risk.\n\n### Final Determination\nBased on the provided financial document, while the company does apply the CECL model under ASC 326 for impairment of financial assets, there is no specific mention of the CECL model being applied to financial assets at fair value. Moreover, the decrease in accounts receivable does not explicitly correlate with impairment reversals as stated.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

            " Sure, let's analyze the statement in detail:\n\n1. **Reverse Stock Split Information**:\n   - From paragraphs 92 and 144, it is clear that a 1-for-3 reverse stock split was implemented on March 27, 2023. As a result, every three shares of common stock were combined into one share, with no change in par value per share.\n   - Due to the reverse stock split, the total number of shares authorized for issuance was reduced from 200,000,000 shares to 66,666,666 shares. This means the authorized shares were effectively increased on a per-share basis in proportion to the reverse stock split.\n\n2. **Proportion of Ownership**:\n   - The reverse stock split reduces the total number of outstanding shares, implying that each share now represents a larger portion of the company, thus increasing the proportion of ownership each share represents.\n\n3. **Impact on Pegasus\u2019s Acquisition Proposals**:\n   - Paragraph 94 states that Pegasus made two acquisition proposals. The first proposal was priced at $0.83 per share in cash, which, due to the 1-for-3 reverse stock split, became $2.49 per share. The second proposal was for $2.85 per share.\n   - The Special Committee concluded that both proposals undervalued the company and thus rejected them.\n\n4. **Effect on Per-Share Value**:\n   - The reverse stock split will typically reduce the overall number of shares, which can potentially increase the per-share value, assuming the market capitalization remains constant. However, the same proportionate increase should also apply to acquisition price per share, maintaining its effective value.\n\n5. **Special Committee\u2019s Evaluation**:\n   - The Special Committee evaluated the proposals not solely based on per-share pricing but on the overall value and strategy, concluding that the proposals undervalued the company.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Total Authorized Shares**: The reverse stock split reduced the total authorized shares from 200 million to approximately 66.7 million. However, this reduction in the number of shares proportionally increases the value of each remaining share.\n- **Per-Share Value**: The per-share value discussed in the proposals was adjusted for the reverse stock split (from $0.83 to $2.49). This indicates that the consideration for each proposal was communicated in relation to the new share structure post-split.\n- **Special Committee\u2019s Decision**: The Special Committee deemed both proposals undervalued and not in the best interest of shareholders, independent of the reverse stock split\u2019s impact on per-share valuation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement contains several aspects that are inconsistent with the financial document provided:\n- The reverse stock split did not \"effectively increase the total authorized shares\"; it reduced them.\n- The reverse stock split did not \"diminish the per-share value\"; the per-share value would proportionally rise assuming the market capitalization remains constant, and the acquisition proposals accounted for this adjustment.\n- The reverse stock split did not directly influence the Special Committee's evaluation of undervaluation; their assessment was based on the intrinsic value and future prospects of the company.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

Paragraph 23 states that reserve estimates from January 1, 2023, were identical to the 2022 annual report, and no new reports were filed that would impact reserves, implying that the reserve data used is consistent across periods.\n2. Paragraph 52 notes the working interests in natural gas extensions and discoveries were not sufficient to replace reserves produced in 2023, indicating a potential issue of reserve depletion.\n3. Paragraphs 75 to 76 discuss the critical role of oil and gas reserve quantities in determining depletion and impairment, indicating that these reserve figures are essential for financial calculations like impairment testing and depreciation.\n4. The use of the units-of-production method for depletion, mentioned in paragraph 75, ties reserve quantities directly to depreciation calculations, meaning any change in reserves directly impacts financial results. An impairment evaluation would be necessary if reserve replacement is inadequate, which impacts future cash flow estimates.\n5. The statement is incorrect because it contradicts the necessity of performing impairment evaluations as critical estimates are impacted by reserve quantities. Inadequate replacement would indeed necessitate impairment evaluations to assess financial impacts like depletion and depreciation.",

            " To verify the given statement, we need to assess two main points:\n1. Whether The Reserve Petroleum Company needed to perform impairment evaluations on its oil and gas reserves.\n2. The impact on depreciation and depletion calculations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Impairment Evaluations:**\n   - Paragraph 75 mentions:\n     > \"...the Company recognizes impairment of proved oil and natural gas properties...based on estimates of proved reserve quantities.\"\n   - According to paragraph 99:\n     > \"The Company assesses its proved oil and gas properties for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.\"\n   - The statement claims that no impairment evaluations were needed despite inadequate replacement of working interest reserves. However, no explicit mention of not needing to perform impairment evaluations is found in the document.\n\n2. **Impact on Depreciation and Depletion:**\n   - Paragraph 61 states:\n     > \"The provision for depletion and depreciation was $3,074,926 in 2023 and $1,543,184 in 2022.\"\n   - Depletion and depreciation are calculated using the units-of-production method and are influenced by changes in estimated reserves, production rate, or the basis of the assets.\n   - The statement suggests that there was no impact on depreciation and depletion calculations. However, the document indicates a significant increase in the provision for depletion and depreciation from 2022 to 2023, implying there was an impact.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe document states that impairments are assessed based on potential indicators and that there was a significant increase in the provision for depletion and depreciation from 2022 to 2023. This contradicts the claim that there was no need for impairment evaluations and that there was no impact on depreciation and depletion calculations.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

This assessment resulted in the Company recording a non-cash impairment charge of $19.8 million...\"\n   - This aligns with the $19.8 million impairment charge mentioned in the statement but specifies it is a \"non-cash\" impairment charge due to a higher discount rate resulting from higher interest rates, not lower discount rates from lower interest rates.\n\n2. **Working Capital Verification:**\n   - To verify the $152.9 million working capital offset claim, we need to examine changes in current assets and current liabilities between December 31, 2023, and July 2, 2023:\n     - Current Assets on December 31, 2023: $544,476 thousand\n     - Current Assets on July 2, 2023: $373,143 thousand\n     - Current Liabilities on December 31, 2023: $341,935 thousand\n     - Current Liabilities on July 2, 2023: $220,261 thousand\n   - Working capital calculation:\n     - Working Capital on December 31, 2023: $544,476 thousand - $341,935 thousand = $202,541 thousand\n     - Working Capital on July 2, 2023: $373,143 thousand - $220,261 thousand = $152,882 thousand\n   - The difference in working capital is: $202,541 thousand - $152,882 thousand = $49,659 thousand\n   - This difference does not match the $152.9 million mentioned in the statement.\n\nTherefore, the analysis concludes that the statement is incorrect on both accounts. The impairment charge was due to higher discount rates from higher interest rates, not lower rates from lower interest rates, and the working capital difference does not match the claimed $152.9 million.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

Increase in Total Stockholders' Equity\nUnfortunately, the provided document does not explicitly state the total stockholders' equity figures for 2022 and 2023.

Improvement in Leverage Ratios\nTo assess leverage ratios, we generally use data such as debt-to-equity or debt-to-assets.\n\nParagraph id = 80 gives us:\n- Total Property, plant, and equipment, net: $348,193 in 2023 and $376,084 in 2022.\n- Manufacturing asset impairment (paragraph id = 43) of $14.7 million in Q4 2023.\n\nUnfortunately, without explicit figures for total stockholders' equity and other assets, we cannot calculate leverage ratios accurately.\n\n### 4. Asset Impairment and Fleet Conversions\nParagraph id = 43 discusses asset impairment and fleet conversions:\n- There has been a significant increase in the conversion of rigs from 200 Series to 300 Series, with 90% of the operating fleet being 300 Series by the end of 2023, compared to only 50% at the start of 2023.\n- Asset impairment mainly reflects the adjustment due to equipment that will no longer be utilized, amounting to $14.7 million in Q4 2023.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the document provides partial data supporting some aspects of the statement (like the decrease in debt), it lacks explicit figures for total stockholders' equity, which is essential for verifying the first part of the statement. Without this critical piece of information, we cannot comprehensively verify the entire claim.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** as we do not have sufficient data to confirm all aspects of the statement accurately."

LINKBANCORP's non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans accounted for 150% of its total risk-based capital.\n2. The regulatory threshold for these loans is 300%.\n3. The bank may need to increase its capital reserves due to heightened regulatory scrutiny and increased capital requirements.\n\nFirst, let's find out the total amount of non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans and the total risk-based capital.\n\nFrom paragraph id = 35, we know that the legal lending limit was $37.2 million at December 31, 2023, which represents 30% of the Bank\u2019s unimpaired capital and surplus (risk-based capital). Therefore, the total risk-based capital was approximately $124 million ($37.2 million / 30%).\n\nFrom paragraph id = 197, we can see that the total amount of non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans was $580,972 thousand at December 31, 2023.\n\nNow, let's calculate the ratio of non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans to total risk-based capital:\n\nRatio = ($580,972 thousand / $124,000 thousand) * 100% \u2248 468.52%\n\nThe regulatory threshold mentioned in the statement is 300%, but according to paragraph id = 35, the actual regulatory threshold for non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans is 30%.\n\nSince the calculated ratio (468.52%) is much higher than the regulatory threshold (30%), LINKBANCORP may indeed need to increase its capital reserves due to heightened regulatory scrutiny and increased capital requirements.\n\n**Conclusion:** The statement is entailed. The financial document supports the assertion that LINKBANCORP may need to increase its capital reserves due to the high ratio of non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans to total risk-based capital, which far exceeds the regulatory threshold. Therefore, the statement is **entailed**."

The warrant had a fair value of $2.4387 per warrant and resulted in a debt discount of $2,190, which is being amortized over the life of the loan.\n\n**Step 3:** Analyze the information related to the warrant issuance and valuation.\n\nFrom paragraph [113]:\n- The document discusses a different warrant issuance (Purchaser Warrant) with a fair value of $2.5968 per warrant, resulting in an expense of $1,212.\n\nFrom paragraph [219]:\n- The warrant related to the Consolidation Term Loan had a fair value of $2.4387 per warrant, and a debt discount of $2,190 was recorded, with incremental interest expense of $1,268 for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n**Step 4:** Determine if the Consolidation Term Loan recorded a gain due to extinguishment and if there was a valuation adjustment of $295 related to the warrant issuance.\n\nThe document does not explicitly mention a gain due to the extinguishment of the Consolidation Term Loan. Furthermore, there is no direct reference to a $295 valuation adjustment related to the warrant issuance in accordance with ASC 470 Debt.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe statement claims that the Consolidation Term Loan recorded a gain due to extinguishment and that the associated warrant issuance resulted in a valuation adjustment of $295. However, the provided financial document does not support these claims. There is no mention of a gain from extinguishment for the Consolidation Term Loan, and the valuation adjustment of $295 is not documented.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

Here\u2019s a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Gather Information About Interest Rates\nWe need to look for any mention of the floating interest rates and margins in the financial document.\n- **[paragraph id = 40]** mentions: \"Borrowings under the credit facilities bear floating interest at either the Base Rate or Term SOFR, plus a margin based on the Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreements). For Base Rate borrowings, the margin ranges from 0.125% to 0.75%. For Term SOFR borrowings, the margin ranges from 1.125% to 1.75% and an incremental Term SOFR adjustment of 0.10%.\"\n\n### Step 2: Review Interest Rate Margins\nThe document specifies that the margins range from 1.125% to 1.75% for Term SOFR borrowings, with an incremental Term SOFR adjustment of 0.10%.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Fixed Differential\nThe statement claims that the company raises its Term SOFR margins by a fixed differential of 1.00%. However, the document mentions variable margins from 1.125% to 1.75% and an incremental adjustment of 0.10%, but no specific fixed differential of 1.00%.\n\n### Step 4: Examine Borrowing Capabilities and 'Accordion' Provision\nThe statement also claims that the maximum borrowing capabilities are linked to an 'accordion' provision allowing an increase of $500 million. However, there is no direct mention of this 'accordion' provision or the $500 million increase in the provided document.\n\n### Step 5: Liquidity Management Strategies and Market Risk Exposure\nThe influence on liquidity management strategies and market risk exposure is an interpretation and not explicitly stated in the document. The statement appears to make an inductive assumption based on the borrowing rates and terms.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nGiven the above steps, the claims in the statement about the fixed differential of 1.00% for Term SOFR margins and the 'accordion' provision allowing an increase of $500 million are not supported by the provided financial document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

Paragraph 93 explains that Arrow Bidco exchanged $181.4 million of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes for 2025 Senior Secured Notes, mentioned as a non-cash activity, indicating a change in terms and maturity through a debt exchange arrangement, which aligns with principles of debt modification in accounting.\n2.

Paragraph 94 provides information on the principal amount and associated unamortized discounts of the 2025 notes, crucial for understanding the total financial burden and supporting the assessment of net present value of remaining cash flows, which is a methodology under debt modification accounting.\n4. Paragraph 96 gives details on the term and outstanding principal amounts, crucial for evaluating net present value (NPV) over these notes' remaining life.\n5. The debt modification accounting concept involves evaluating whether changes exceed a certain threshold, typically using NPV analysis to ensure the present value of new cash flows is not substantially different from old terms. This ex post facto analysis justifies Arrow Bidco\u2019s decision by aligning with standard accounting practices for managing changes in debt structure.\n6. The statement incorrectly claims that the interest rate for the 2025 Senior Secured Notes is 8.75%, whereas it is actually 10.75% as specified in the context.

However, it mentions that he holds 290,000 unexercised options (paragraph id = 137). To find out if this represents 1.40% of the shares, we need to know the total number of shares outstanding.\n   - According to the Consolidated Balance Sheets (paragraph id = 77), there are 20,426,158 shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2023.\n   - To calculate the percentage of shares Gregg Budoi owns, we use the formula: (Number of shares owned / Total shares outstanding) * 100.

We need to verify this amount in the document.\n2. **Equity Liabilities**: The statement refers to deferring equity liabilities, implying that these deposits are related to equity transactions or liabilities.\n3. **ASC 815**: This accounting standard relates to derivatives and hedging activities. The statement suggests that the deposits have implications under ASC 815.\n4. **Public Warrants**: The statement mentions the risk of Public Warrants expiring without value if no Business Combination is achieved, which should also be reflected in the document.\n\nLet's analyze the document step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Verify Extension Deposits Amount\nAccording to paragraphs [29] and [84], extension deposits are mentioned in the context of extending the Termination Date for completing a business combination. These deposits result in non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory notes.\n\n- From paragraph [29]: \"Our stockholders have approved the issuance of the placement units upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the holder wishes to so convert such notes at the time of the consummation of our initial business combination.\"\n- From paragraph [84]: Similar details are repeated.\n\nHowever, the document does not explicitly mention the total amount of extension deposits being $178,024. We need to check other parts of the document to verify this amount.\n\n### Step 2: Equity Liabilities\nExtension deposits, when converted into placement units, effectively become equity liabilities, as implied by the statement. This is supported by the document:\n\n- From paragraph [29]: \"Such notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, or, at the relevant insider\u2019s discretion, converted upon consummation of our business combination into additional placement units at a price of $10.00 per unit.\"\n\nThis indicates that the extension deposits can be converted into equity, which supports the statement's reference to equity liabilities.\n\n### Step 3: ASC 815 Implications\nThe statement suggests that the deposits have implications under ASC 815, which deals with derivatives and hedging activities. While the document does not explicitly mention ASC 815, the potential conversion of notes into equity units could have accounting implications similar to those under ASC 815.\n\n### Step 4: Public Warrants\nThe document mentions the risk associated with Public Warrants in paragraph [84]:\n\n- From paragraph [84]: \"There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination by the Termination Date.\"\n\nThis aligns with the statement's reference to the risk of Public Warrants expiring without value if no Business Combination is achieved.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the document, the statement is partially supported by the details provided:\n\n1. The document discusses extension deposits and their conversion into equity liabilities.\n2. The risk of Public Warrants expiring without value is clearly stated.\n3. The implications under ASC 815 are not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the nature of the transactions.\n\nHowever, the specific amount of $178,024 for extension deposits is not explicitly verified in the provided text.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted** due to the lack of explicit verification of the $178,024 amount."

This is significantly less than the 1.26 million shares mentioned in the statement.\n\n### Step 3: Impact on Cash Flows\n**Statement Component:** \"significantly impacting its cash flows\"\n\nFrom the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\n- **Proceeds from issuance of common stock for EB-5 program:** $880,000\n- **Related party LOC in exchange for common stock for EB-5 program:** ($880,000) (offsetting the proceeds)\n- There is no significant net impact on cash flows from the EB-5 program.\n\n### Step 4: Offset of Fair Value Change of Assets\n**Statement Component:** \"helping to offset a fair value change of assets worth $30 million\"\n\nFrom the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss:\n- **Change in fair value of assets, net (Note 6):** $3,045,954 (for 2023)\n\nThere is no $30 million change in fair value of assets mentioned in the document.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the provided financial document:\n- The company indeed faced financial distress, indicating substantial doubt about its going concern.\n- The number of shares issued through the EB-5 program was 44,010, not approximately 1.26 million.\n- The issued shares did not significantly impact cash flows, as the net effect was zero.\n- The change in fair value of assets was $3,045,954, not $30 million.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted. **Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

The statement mentions two primary aspects:\n\n1. Ineffective disclosure controls confirmed by the CEO and CFO by December 2023.\n2. Increased market risks due to foreign exchange volatility and interest rate exposure, managed using forward contracts and interest rate swaps.\n\nLet's analyze the document step-by-step to find evidence for these points:\n\n### Step 1: Search for Information on Disclosure Controls\n\nThe statement mentions \"ineffective disclosure controls.\" We need to find any part of the document that discusses disclosure controls or any related notes from the CEO or CFO.\n\n**Document Analysis:**\n- The document does not explicitly mention \"ineffective disclosure controls\" or any statements made by the CEO and CFO regarding disclosure controls. Therefore, we do not have evidence to support this part of the statement.\n\n### Step 2: Search for Information on Market Risks, Foreign Exchange Volatility, and Interest Rates\n\nThe statement also mentions increased market risks due to foreign exchange volatility and interest rate exposure, necessitating the use of forward contracts and interest rate swaps.\n\n**Document Analysis:**\n- **Paragraph id = 77** discusses financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. It mentions \"foreign currency hedge contracts\" and \"interest rate swaps,\" which are tools used to manage foreign exchange volatility and interest rate exposure.\n  - **As of December 30, 2023:**\n    - Foreign currency hedge contracts: $18 (liability), $668 (asset)\n    - Interest rate swaps: $472 (liability), $1,146 (asset)\n  - **As of April 1, 2023:**\n    - Foreign currency hedge contracts: $24 (liability), $1,401 (asset)\n    - Interest rate swaps: $1,807 (liability), $1,110 (asset)\n\n- **Paragraph id = 143** mentions various risks, including security breaches, pricing pressures, disruptions to the supply chain, and the potential effect of foreign currency fluctuations and interest rate fluctuations on the company's net sales, expenses, and resulting margins.\n\n### Final Determination:\n\n1. The document does not provide any evidence regarding \"ineffective disclosure controls confirmed by the CEO and CFO by December 2023.\"\n2. The document does provide evidence that the company faced market risks due to foreign exchange volatility and interest rate exposure, as it mentions foreign currency hedge contracts and interest rate swaps.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **partially entailed** by the document. While the document supports the use of forward contracts and interest rate swaps to manage market risks, it does not mention any confirmation of ineffective disclosure controls by the CEO and CFO.\n\n**Conclusion:** Due to the lack of evidence regarding \"ineffective disclosure controls,\" the statement is refuted.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

We need to find and compare these values from the balance sheet as of January 31, 2024, and July 31, 2023.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Relevant Data from the Balance Sheet\nFrom the provided balance sheet:\n- **Current Assets as of January 31, 2024:** $9,730\n- **Current Assets as of July 31, 2023:** $7,037\n- **Current Liabilities as of January 31, 2024:** $4,572,172\n- **Current Liabilities as of July 31, 2023:** $4,497,473\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Working Capital\n- **Working Capital as of January 31, 2024:** $9,730 - $4,572,172 = -$4,562,442\n- **Working Capital as of July 31, 2023:** $7,037 - $4,497,473 = -$4,490,436\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Working Capital\nThe working capital has decreased from July 31, 2023, to January 31, 2024, because it went from -$4,490,436 to -$4,562,442.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze Related Party Transactions and Revenue Generation\n- **Related Party Transactions:** The document mentions related party transactions such as loans and related party receivables and payables. However, it does not specify any improvement in working capital directly related to these transactions.\n- **Revenue Generation from Transactions Involving a Major Shareholder\u2019s Relatives:** There is no clear indication in the provided document that revenue generation from such transactions has contributed to an improvement in the working capital position.\n\n### Step 6: Conclude the Analysis\nThe data shows that the working capital has actually worsened from July 31, 2023, to January 31, 2024. Additionally, there is no explicit evidence in the document to support that related party transactions or revenue generation from transactions involving a major shareholder\u2019s relatives have improved the working capital position.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe statement \"Hartford Great Health Corp faced an improving working capital position as of January 31, 2024, buoyed by related party transactions and consistent revenue generation from transactions involving a major shareholder\u2019s relatives\" is not supported by the provided document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

The Company\u2019s objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations. The Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n     ```\n   - This paragraph indicates that Disney does engage in foreign exchange risk management practices.\n\n3. **Net Foreign Exchange Loss**:\n   - Reviewing the document for any mention of a net foreign exchange loss of $91 million in Q4 2023:\n\nUnfortunately, the provided document does not explicitly mention a net foreign exchange loss of $91 million in Q4 2023.

The company anticipates not being able to repay the debt in case of a breach, raising substantial doubt about its ability to continue operating.\n\n2. **Strategic Plans**:\n   - Paragraph [115] mentions strategic initiatives, including a potential sale-leaseback transaction for the company's manufacturing and distribution campus in Fayetteville, North Carolina.

However, the financial document provides substantial evidence to the contrary:\n\n- The company faces significant going concern issues due to potential breaches of financial covenants.\n- The success of the sale-leaseback strategy is uncertain and not guaranteed to alleviate these concerns.\n- The company continues to experience persistent operating losses.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

Let's break down the statement and analyze each component:\n\n1. **Gain from interest rate swaps:**\n   The statement claims that the company recognized a $6.3 million gain from interest rate swaps as part of the cost of sales. We need to find the section of the document that discusses gains or losses related to interest rate swaps.\n\n2. **Reclassifications from OCI:**\n   The statement also mentions that this gain aligns with reclassifications from Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). We need to check if any reclassifications from OCI to the income statement involving interest rate swaps are mentioned.\n\n3. **Net asset position for derivatives:**\n   The statement notes a decreased net asset position for these derivatives. We should look for any information about the fair value of interest rate swap agreements.\n\n4. **Expectations of market adjustments:**\n   The statement refers to expectations of market adjustments. This part is more subjective and harder to quantify directly from the document, but we can check for any context that supports or refutes market adjustments.\n\nLet's analyze the document step by step:\n\n**1. Gain from interest rate swaps:**\n\nThe document contains the following relevant information:\n\n[paragraph id = 274]\n\"The fair value of all interest rate swap agreements was a net asset of $ 11.9 million and $ 16.1 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The mark-to-market effect of interest rate swap agreements that are considered effective as hedges has been included in OCI. Based on market valuations at December 31, 2023, $ 6.0 million of the net deferred gain included in OCI is expected to be reclassified as income in the Consolidated Statement of Operations over the next twelve months, as cash flow payments are made in accordance with the interest rate swap agreements.\"\n\nHere, it is mentioned that $6.0 million of the net deferred gain included in OCI is expected to be reclassified as income over the next twelve months. However, this does not specify where this gain will be recognized in the statement of operations (e.g., cost of sales, interest expense, etc.).\n\n**2. Reclassifications from OCI:**\n\n[paragraph id = 277]\n| Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships | Amount of Gain or (Loss) Recognized in OCI on Derivative (Effective Portion) | Location of Gain or (Loss) Reclassified from OCI into Income (Effective Portion) | Amount of Gain or (Loss) Reclassified from OCI into Income (Effective Portion) |\n| 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |\n| Cash Flow Hedges |\n| Interest rate swap agreements | $ 1.9 | $ 21.9 | $ 5.8 | Interest expense | $ 6.3 | $ 1.2 | $ 3.2 |\n\nThe table shows that for 2023, $6.3 million of the gain from interest rate swap agreements was reclassified from OCI into income and was recognized as interest expense. This contradicts the statement's claim that the gain was recognized as part of the cost of sales.\n\n**3. Net asset position for derivatives:**\n\nThe document states that the fair value of interest rate swap agreements was a net asset of $11.9 million at December 31, 2023, down from $16.1 million at December 31, 2022. This confirms the decreased net asset position for these derivatives.\n\n**4. Expectations of market adjustments:**\n\nThe document does not provide explicit information about market adjustments, but the reduction in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements from $16.1 million to $11.9 million could imply market adjustments or changes in the value of the derivatives.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement is refuted because the $6.3 million gain from interest rate swaps was recognized as interest expense, not as part of the cost of sales.

The relevant information is in paragraph id = 344:\n\n| December 31, 2020 | December 31, 2021 | December 31, 2022 |\n| Interest rate swaps | $    \u2014    | $ -  | $ 1,308,503 |\n\n| December 31, 2023 |\n| Interest rate swap | $   \u2014    | $ 627,676 |\n\nThe statement suggests an increase in the fair value of interest rate swaps in 2023, but the numbers from the document do not support an increase. Instead, they show a decrease from $1,308,503 in 2022 to $627,676 in 2023.\n\n### Step 2: Examine the Cash and Cash Equivalent Balances\nThe statement suggests that the company maintained a substantial portion of its cash equivalent balance. However, there is no direct mention of cash and cash equivalents in the provided document.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the information in the document, the fair value of interest rate swaps actually decreased from $1,308,503 in 2022 to $627,676 in 2023, which contradicts the statement. Additionally, the document does not provide any details about cash and cash equivalent balances.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted. The statement is 'refuted'."

Paragraph 42 supports understanding of shareholder dynamics, indicating that despite acquiring full control, existing shareholders could own a minority of the entity after new shares are issued to facilitate the acquisition.\n4. Valuation multipliers, often used to gauge fair market value, could impact ownership percentages and trigger minority shareholder outcomes, aligning with reverse merger characteristics.\n5. The statement is incorrect because issuing a substantial number of new shares to acquire a 100% stake can result in original shareholders holding a minority interest.

If enough new shares are issued, original shareholders could own less than 50% of the company post-transaction.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The statement is not always true. While acquiring a 100% stake in a target business ensures full control of that business, issuing new shares can dilute the ownership of original shareholders, potentially reducing their stake to less than a majority.

Our industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and standards. These technological developments require us to integrate new technology and standards into our products, create new and relevant categories of products and adapt to changing business models in a timely manner. [...] Our failure to improve our products, create new and relevant categories of products and adapt to changing business models in a timely manner may seriously harm our business.\n     ```\n   - This paragraph indicates the importance of innovation for Corsair Gaming and the potential negative impact if they fail to keep up with technological advancements.\n\n3. **Discussions on Strategic Alliances:**\n   There is no explicit mention of strategic alliances in the provided sections.\n\n4. **Discussions on the Gaming Hardware Ecosystem:**\n   - The document broadly discusses the gaming industry, including potential shifts and risks such as migration to mobile devices and tablets (paragraph 74).\n     ```markdown\n     \u2022the rate of growth of PCs and gaming consoles or the migration of gamers to mobile devices and tablets away from PCs, which historically have been the core focus of our business;\n     ```\n   - Additionally, it mentions the interplay between hardware and software within the gaming industry, reinforcing the idea of an ecosystem.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- From the provided information, it is clear that Corsair Gaming acknowledges the rapid evolution of technology in the gaming industry and its dependency on continuous innovation.\n- The statement asserts that a decline in hardware innovation negates the need for strategic alliances. However, the document does not explicitly mention strategic alliances or how a decline in innovation would impact the need for such alliances.\n- The lack of explicit discussion on strategic alliances in the context of innovation makes it challenging to draw a direct conclusion from the document.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the provided document, there is no direct evidence to support or refute the specific impact of a decline in gaming hardware innovation on the need for strategic alliances. The document focuses on the importance of innovation but does not discuss strategic alliances or their relationship with innovation trends.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

The company's disclosure controls were effective in providing clarity on the impact of debt on financial stability.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Working Capital Deficit Increase Linked to Currency Translation**\n   - The statement claims that there was a significant increase in the working capital deficit primarily due to currency translation. We need to check for evidence of this in the financial document.\n   - In the financial document, paragraph [paragraph id = 62], it states:\n     \"At December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, the Company had a working capital deficit of $238,961 and $113,179 respectively. The change in cash is primarily due to currency translation.\"\n   - This supports the claim that there was an increase in the working capital deficit and links it to currency translation.\n\n2. **Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls**\n   - The statement also suggests that the company's disclosure controls were effective in providing clarity on the impact of debt on financial stability.\n   - Disclosure controls would typically include thorough notation and explanation of financial results and significant changes.\n   - The financial document provides detailed statements of operations, cash flows, and changes in stockholders\u2019 equity, including comprehensive explanations of significant transactions and factors affecting financial stability, such as currency translation adjustments.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the provided financial document:\n- The working capital deficit did increase significantly from $113,179 to $238,961, and this increase is linked primarily to currency translation.\n- The document provides detailed financial information and explanatory notes, indicating effective disclosure controls.\n\nTherefore, the statement is supported by the document.\n\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, the statement is entailed."

We need to find these values in the financial documents.\n\n   - The document provides the trust account balance at the end of several periods in 2022 and 2023 but does not directly provide the balance at the end of 2021.\n   - The trust account balances at the end of 2022 and 2023 are:\n     - December 31, 2022: $34,454,043 (as restated)\n     - September 30, 2023: $35,414,428 (as restated)\n\n2. **Compare the data with the statement**: The statement claims that the trust account balance decreased from $58,076,283 at the end of 2021 to $35,909,651 at the end of 2023.

            " To assess the truthfulness of the given statement, let's break it down and analyze it step by step, focusing on the information provided in the financial document.\n\n### Key Components of the Statement:\n1. **Effective disclosure controls as per the COSO framework**: This is a general statement about the company's internal controls and does not provide specific financial data to analyze.\n2. **Potential upgrade of the $450 million Senior Notes due in 2024**: The statement mentions Senior Notes due in 2024, which are indeed listed in the document.\n3. **Could increase interest costs**: This implies a potential change in interest rates related to these Senior Notes.\n4. **Interplay between credit ratings and interest rate adjustments in financial risk management**: This suggests that the interest rate could change if the credit rating of the Senior Notes is adjusted.\n\n### Analysis Based on the Financial Document:\n\n#### Senior Notes Due in 2024:\n- From the document, we find the following details about the Senior Notes due in 2024:\n\n  | December 30, 2023 | April 1, 2023 |\n  |-------------------|----------------|\n  | Carrying Value    | $449           | $449 |\n  | Estimated Fair Value | $440           | $435 |\n\n  This confirms that Senior Notes due in 2024 are part of the company's debt facilities.\n\n#### Interest Costs:\n- The document provides interest expense information:\n\n  | Three Months Ended |\n  |--------------------|\n  | December 30, 2023 | $1        |\n  | December 31, 2022 | $12       |\n  | $ Change           | (11)      |\n  | % Change           | (91.7)    |\n\n  The document shows that interest expense decreased significantly, which is the opposite of the statement's implication of an increase in interest costs.\n\n#### No Direct Mention of Potential Upgrade:\n- The document does not mention a potential upgrade of the Senior Notes or changes in credit ratings.\n- There is also no discussion about the direct impact of such an upgrade on interest costs.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the available information, the statement suggests that the potential upgrade of the $450 million Senior Notes due in 2024 could increase interest costs. However, the financial document shows a decrease in interest expense and does not discuss any potential upgrade or its impact on interest costs. Therefore, the statement contradicts the information provided in the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

Let's check the signatures section of the document to see if both the CEO and CFO have signed the report.\n\nIn the provided financial document, we can see the signatures section:\n\n```\nSIGNATURES\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.\nDESTINY MEDIA TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\n\n| By | /s/Frederick Vandenberg |\n| Frederick Vandenberg |\n| Chief Executive Officer, President |\n| (Principal Executive Officer) |\n| Date: January 16, 2024 |\n| By: | /s/ Olya Massalitina |\n| Olya Massalitina |\n| Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer |\n| (Principal Financing and Accounting Officer) |\n| Date: January 16, 2024 |\n```\n\nBoth the Chief Executive Officer (Frederick Vandenberg) and the Chief Financial Officer (Olya Massalitina) have signed the report, indicating compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\n### Step 2: Absence of Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Defaults on Senior Securities\n\nThe statement also mentions that there are no unregistered sales of equity securities or defaults on senior securities. Let's check these sections in the document.\n\n#### Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities\n```\nITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.\nNone.\n```\nThis section clearly states \"None,\" indicating that there are no unregistered sales of equity securities.\n\n#### Defaults on Senior Securities\n```\nITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES.\nNone.\n```\nThis section also states \"None,\" indicating that there are no defaults on senior securities.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe statement mentions that only the CEO certifies the accuracy of financial statements, but the document shows that both the CEO and CFO have certified the financial statements. This contradicts the statement.\n\nHowever, the statement correctly indicates that the company has no unregistered sales of equity securities or defaults on senior securities, which is supported by the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** because it incorrectly suggests that only the CEO certifies the financial statements, when in reality, both the CEO and CFO have certified them.\n\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, the statement is **refuted**."

Paragraph 306 provides a quantitative perspective on foreign currency risks by stating that a 10% change in exchange rates impacts gains or losses by $1.9 million.\n5. Combining these points, one can see the complexity in predicting accurate financial outcomes due to both variable incentives and foreign currency factors, underlining the difficulty in precise financial forecasting when both elements are volatile.\n6.

Whether a 10% fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the net gain or loss on foreign currency contracts by approximately $1.5 million.\n\n### Step 1: Critical Audit Matter - Variable Consideration from Customer Incentives\n- From the provided paragraphs, there is no explicit mention of \"variable consideration from customer incentives\" being a critical audit matter. The document discusses various financial metrics and risks but does not specifically highlight this aspect.\n\n### Step 2: Impact of 10% Fluctuation in Exchange Rates\n- To analyze this part, we need to identify the relevant figures related to foreign currency contracts. The key pieces of data to look for include:\n  - The percentage of net revenue denominated in foreign currencies.\n  - Any mention of the financial impact of currency fluctuations.\n\nFrom [paragraph id = 256], we have the net revenue figures:\n- Net revenue for 2023: $1,459,875\n- Net revenue for 2022: $1,375,098\n\nFrom [paragraph id = 339], the geographical distribution of net revenue:\n- Americas (2023): $751,069\n- Europe and Middle East (2023): $512,161\n- Asia Pacific (2023): $196,645\n\nAdding up Europe and Middle East and Asia Pacific gives us the foreign currency-related revenue:\n- Foreign currency revenue for 2023: $512,161 + $196,645 = $708,806\n\n**Percentage of net revenue denominated in foreign currencies:**\n\\[ \\frac{708,806}{1,459,875} \\approx 0.485 \\text{ or } 48.5\\% \\]\n\nThe statement mentions \"25% of net revenue is denominated in foreign currencies,\" which is incorrect. Approximately 48.5% (not 25%) of the net revenue is from foreign currencies.\n\n### Impact Calculation:\nIf 10% fluctuation in exchange rates impacts the net gain or loss on foreign currency contracts by approximately $1.5 million, we would expect to see a reference to this impact in the financial statements or disclosures. However, there is no explicit mention of such an impact in the provided paragraphs.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- There is no explicit mention that variable consideration from customer incentives is a critical audit matter.\n- 48.5%, not 25%, of net revenue is denominated in foreign currencies.\n- There is no data to support the statement that a 10% fluctuation in exchange rates would impact the net gain or loss on foreign currency contracts by approximately $1.5 million.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

        "explanation": "1. Paragraph 148 outlines the interest rate conditions for borrowings under the Credit Facility, linking them to market rates and adding a margin, setting the baseline for financial obligations incurred if borrowing occurs.\n2. Paragraph 149 details that 80% of certain revenues and 80% or 60% of accounts receivable form the borrowing base, subject to audits, ensuring liquidity coverage for the covenants mentioned in Paragraph 150.\n3. Paragraph 150 discusses covenants under the Credit Facility, which restrict certain financial activities, including incurring additional indebtedness or repurchasing shares without meeting specified criteria.\n4. Paragraph 151 states there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility at key fiscal periods, implying the company managed its capital to avoid breaching covenants that might otherwise force borrowing.\n5.

Therefore, we cannot conclude how lease accounting is performed or whether it employs internal estimations regardless of market conditions.\n\n4. **Assess the statement**:\n   - The first part of the statement is true: the Company's reliance on Level 2 fair value measurement for cash equivalents and derivatives involves using market data.\n   - The second part of the statement cannot be verified as true or false because the document does not provide information on lease accounting.\n\n**Conclusion**: Since we cannot verify the second part of the statement due to insufficient information, we cannot conclude that the statement is entirely true. Therefore, the statement is **refuted**."

            " To verify the given statement, we need to analyze the provided financial document and focus on the relevant sections that discuss HealthEquity's reliance on insurance company partners for HSA cash and any associated risks. Here\u2019s the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Context and Relevant Sections**:\n    - **Paragraph 69**: This paragraph discusses the risks associated with the failure of depository or insurance company partners, noting that HSA cash held by insurance company partners is not federally insured and that members bear the risk of loss.\n    - **Paragraph 70**: This paragraph elaborates on the potential adverse effects on the company if a material adverse event affects one of the Depository Partners or insurance company partners.\n    - **Paragraph 72**: This paragraph discusses the impact of failing to adequately manage the liquidity of custodial assets.\n\n2. **Key Information Extraction**:\n    - **Insurance Company Partners**: HealthEquity relies on insurance company partners to hold HSA cash, and the portion of HSA cash held by these partners is increasing with the adoption of the Enhanced Rates program.\n    - **Risks Associated with Insurance Company Partners**: The text explicitly highlights the risks, stating that HSA cash held through insurance company partners is not federally insured, and members bear the risk of loss. It also mentions that failure of an insurance company partner could result in reputational and financial harm to the company.\n    - **Contractual Arrangements**: The text does not provide strong assurances about the sufficiency of contractual arrangements to protect against these risks.\n\n3. **Contradiction with the Given Statement**:\n    - The given statement suggests that HealthEquity's reliance on insurance company partners could \"solidify the company's brand integrity and financial stability, should an adverse event occur.\"\n    - However, the financial document clearly states the opposite: that reliance on insurance company partners involves significant risks, and an adverse event could result in \"reputational and financial harm\" to the company.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n    - Based on the provided document, HealthEquity's reliance on insurance company partners for HSA cash presents risks, and an adverse event would likely result in reputational and financial harm.\n    - Therefore, the given statement is not supported by the document.\n\nConclusion:\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

Accrued compensation arrangements link stock-based compensations to expenses in financial statements, and deferred tax asset valuation adjustments reflect future income expectations, causing changes in asset valuation aligned with strategic financial management.\n5. The statement incorrectly refers to an increase in the net operating loss deferred tax asset, when in reality, the net operating loss carryforwards were eliminated by December 2023, showing that there was no balance for them at the end of the year.

The statement has two main components:\n\n1. A decline in stock-based compensation expenses from 2022 to 2023.\n2. An increase in the net operating loss deferred tax asset from 2022 to 2023.\n\n### Analysis of Stock-Based Compensation Expenses\nLet's refer to paragraph id = 109 under \"CPS TECHNOLOGIES CORP. STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 30, 2023 AND DECEMBER 31, 2022\":\n\n- Share-based compensation expense for 2022 is $250,359.\n- Share-based compensation expense for 2023 is $204,797.\n\nThere is indeed a decline in stock-based compensation expenses from 2022 to 2023.\n\n### Analysis of Net Operating Loss Deferred Tax Asset\nNow, let's refer to paragraph id = 147 under \"Deferred tax assets as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022\":\n\n- Net operating loss carryforwards for 2022 are $132,632.\n- Net operating loss carryforwards for 2023 are $\u2014 (indicating zero or an insignificant amount).\n\nHowever, the statement claims an \"increase\" in the net operating loss deferred tax asset, which contradicts the provided financial document showing a decrease.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe statement claims a decline in stock-based compensation expenses and an increase in the net operating loss deferred tax asset. While the decline in stock-based compensation expenses is supported by the document, the increase in the net operating loss deferred tax asset is not.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted.\n\n**Conclusion: \"Therefore, the statement is refuted.\"**"
