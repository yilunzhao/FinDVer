We need to look for sections that discuss fair value measurements, assets, and liabilities, specifically any mentions of \"total assets at fair value\" or \"long-term debt carrying value of solar sale leasebacks.\"\n\n### Step 2: Identify Relevant Sections and Data\n\n- **Total Assets at Fair Value**: The document does not mention a total value for assets measured at fair value directly. However, it provides a \"Derivative Fair Value Sensitivity Analysis\" which lists the fair value of Henry Hub Futures and Fixed Price Swaps. We do not see a section explicitly mentioning total assets at fair value of $32,253 thousand.\n\n- **Long-term Debt Carrying Value of Solar Sale Leasebacks**: There is no specific table or note in the provided financial document that lists a long-term debt carrying value related to solar sale leasebacks.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Data\n\n- The document does not provide any explicit figures for total assets at fair value of $32,253 thousand.\n- Additionally, there is no mention of a long-term debt carrying value of solar sale leasebacks amounting to $278.4 million, let alone categorizing it within the Level 2 fair value hierarchy.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the provided financial document does not include the specific figures mentioned in the statement (total assets at fair value of $32,253 thousand and long-term debt carrying value of solar sale leasebacks amounting to $278.4 million), the statement cannot be supported by the information in the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

Let's break down our analysis step by step:\n\n1. **Context of the Financial Document:**\n   - The document discusses various aspects of OSG's operations, including time charters, environmental regulations, EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), international operations, and insurance.\n\n2. **Relevant Sections for Analysis:**\n   - Paragraph 48 discusses the EU ETS and mentions that \"some of this revenue is allocated to the maritime sector to support innovation in low-carbon technologies and to contribute to zero pollution objectives.\"\n   - No specific mention is made about OSG exploring opportunities in transporting liquified CO2 or a shift towards renewable energy.\n\n3. **Statement Analysis:**\n   - The statement to verify is: \"OSG is exploring opportunities in transporting liquified CO2 reflecting a shift towards renewable energy, amidst the EU Emissions Trading Scheme that allocates all revenue to sectors outside maritime innovations.\"\n\n4. **Comparison with Financial Document:**\n   - The document does not mention any exploration opportunities for transporting liquified CO2.\n   - The document explicitly states that some revenue from the EU ETS is allocated to the maritime sector to support innovation in low-carbon technologies, which contradicts the statement that all revenue is allocated to sectors outside maritime innovations.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the document does not support the claim that OSG is exploring opportunities in transporting liquified CO2 and contradicts the allocation of EU ETS revenue, the statement is refuted.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

            " To assess the truthfulness of the given statement, we need to verify the following three components based on the provided financial document:\n\n1. Knightscope, Inc. generated $578 from converting preferred stock to common stock.\n2. Knightscope, Inc. recognized a net loss of $22,118 for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n3. Knightscope, Inc. had a working capital of $1.3 million.\n\nLet's analyze each component separately.\n\n### 1. Generating $578 from Converting Preferred Stock to Common Stock\nFrom [paragraph id = 65], we have the following information:\n- **Out of period adjustment** for \"Goodwill recorded pursuant to the CASE acquisition\" was $578.\n\nThere is no specific mention of converting preferred stock to common stock resulting in $578, but the \"out of period adjustment\" could be related to such an event. However, without explicit context, we cannot definitively link the $578 to the conversion of preferred stock to common stock.\n\n### 2. Recognizing a Net Loss of $22,118 for the Year Ended December 31, 2023\nFrom [paragraph id = 65], we have the following information:\n- **Net loss** for the period is listed as $(22,118).\n\nThis directly supports the statement about recognizing a net loss of $22,118 for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n### 3. Having a Working Capital of $1.3 million\nThe financial document provided does not explicitly state the working capital. To determine the working capital, we would need the values for current assets and current liabilities, which are not clearly provided in the excerpts given.\n\n### Conclusion\n- The statement about generating $578 from converting preferred stock to common stock is not explicitly supported by the document.\n- The statement about recognizing a net loss of $22,118 for the year ended December 31, 2023 is supported by the document.\n- The statement about having a working capital of $1.3 million cannot be verified due to insufficient data.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted** due to the lack of explicit evidence for the $578 generation from converting preferred stock to common stock and insufficient data on working capital."

Decrease in same store sales by 20% in fiscal year 2023 compared to 2022.\n2. Opening of 15 new stores during fiscal year 2023.\n3. Increase in firearms sales by $1.5 million driven by the new store openings and a 53-week fiscal year.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n**1. Decrease in Same Store Sales by 20% in Fiscal Year 2023 Compared to 2022:**\n\nThe financial document does not explicitly mention a 20% decrease in same store sales. However, it provides information on decreases in net sales across various departments. Let's examine the relevant data:\n\n- Paragraph 192 mentions decreases in net sales across different departments like Camping, Hunting and Shooting, Apparel, Optics, Electronics and Accessories, Fishing, and Footwear.\n- The document states that these decreases were driven by consumer inflationary pressures and recessionary concerns, resulting in a decline in store traffic and lower demand.\n\nHowever, there is no specific mention of a 20% decrease in same store sales explicitly stated.\n\n**2. Opening of 15 New Stores During Fiscal Year 2023:**\n\n- Paragraph 192 explicitly mentions: \"These headwinds were partially offset by our opening of 15 new stores in fiscal year 2023...\"\n\nThis confirms that 15 new stores were opened during fiscal year 2023.\n\n**3. Increase in Firearms Sales by $1.5 Million Driven by the New Store Openings and a 53-Week Fiscal Year:**\n\n- Paragraph 192 states: \"Within our Hunting and Shooting department, sales from our firearms category increased by $1.5 million, or 0.5%, for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022. This increase in firearms sales was driven by the opening of new stores and fiscal year 2023 containing 53 weeks as compared to 52 weeks for fiscal year 2022.\"\n\nThis confirms that firearms sales increased by $1.5 million driven by new store openings and the additional week in fiscal year 2023.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The statement claims a 20% decrease in same store sales in fiscal year 2023 compared to 2022. However, the document does not explicitly mention this percentage decrease. It only mentions decreases in net sales across various departments without quantifying the overall decrease.\n- The statement correctly mentions the opening of 15 new stores during fiscal year 2023.\n- The statement correctly mentions an increase in firearms sales by $1.5 million driven by new store openings and a 53-week fiscal year.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted because the document does not support the claim of a 20% decrease in same store sales explicitly.\n\n**Conclusion:** \"Therefore, the statement is refuted.\""

The statement consists of two main parts:\n\n1. PSOC raised $700 million in net proceeds from a recent senior notes offering.\n2. PSOC plans to spend approximately $180 million on capital expenditures for facility maintenance and improvements in 2024, and expects $120 million to be devoted to solar panel installations.\n\nLet's analyze each part step by step:\n\n### Part 1: Net Proceeds from Senior Notes Offering\nThe document does not provide any information about a recent senior notes offering or the net proceeds from such an offering. There are no paragraphs that mention the issuance of senior notes or any financing activities that yielded $700 million.\n\n### Part 2: Capital Expenditures and Solar Panel Installations\nThe document provides information about capital expenditures for facility maintenance and improvements, as well as solar panel installations in paragraphs 72 and 172:\n\n- **Paragraph 72 and 172:** The company mentions two programs:\n  - **Property of Tomorrow Program:** The company spent $25 million in the three months ended March 31, 2024, and expects to spend approximately $150 million over 2024.\n  - **Solar Program:** The company spent $13 million in the three months ended March 31, 2024, and expects to spend $100 million over 2024.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Senior Notes Offering:**\n   The document does not mention any senior notes offering or any net proceeds related to such an offering. Therefore, the statement about raising $700 million in net proceeds from a recent senior notes offering is not supported by the document.\n\n2. **Capital Expenditures:**\n   - The document mentions spending approximately $150 million on the Property of Tomorrow program and $100 million on the solar program in 2024.\n   - The statement claims that $180 million will be spent on capital expenditures for facility maintenance and improvements, which includes both the Property of Tomorrow program and any other facility maintenance.\n   - The statement also claims that $120 million will be devoted to solar panel installations, but the document mentions a planned expenditure of $100 million.\n\nGiven this analysis, the statement is partially refuted by the document:\n\n1. The document does not mention any recent senior notes offering or net proceeds of $700 million.\n2. The document mentions planned expenditures of $150 million for the Property of Tomorrow program and $100 million for the solar program, which slightly differs from the amounts mentioned in the statement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

However, there is no direct evidence discussing the terms of any capital raising efforts.\n\n3. **Control by Insiders**:\n   - The statement mentions that approximately 32% of shares are controlled by insiders.\n   - The document provides details on the number of shares but does not explicitly state the percentage controlled by insiders. We would need the definition of \"insiders\" and further context to verify this claim.\n\n4. **No Dividends Paid**:\n   - The statement indicates that no dividends are expected to be paid in the foreseeable future.\n   - There is no mention of dividends in the provided financial document. This suggests that the company did not pay dividends, aligning with the statement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe provided financial document does not contain explicit information to support the market stock price fluctuation between $1.69 and $3.98 in 2023, nor does it specify the percentage of shares controlled by insiders. While it mentions potential dilution through stock issuance, there is no direct evidence of unfavorable terms related to capital raising. The document does not address dividends, which could imply no dividends are being paid.\n\nGiven the lack of explicit evidence to support the stock price fluctuation and insider control percentage, the statement cannot be confirmed based on the provided document.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

This matches the statement.\n\n2. **Verify Cash Distributions to Unit Holders in 2023**:\n   The same table shows that the Cash Distributions to Unit Holders were $863,852 in 2023, not $830,151 as stated. This contradicts the statement.\n\n3. **Verify Deficiencies in Contingent Portion Payments in 2023**:\n   Looking at the table in paragraph id = 25 or 29, we need to sum the deficiencies for the four quarters of 2023:\n   - March 31, 2023: $44,908\n   - June 30, 2023: $37,491\n   - September 30, 2023: $131,213\n   - December 31, 2023: $40,761\n\n   Summing these amounts gives us a total deficiency of $254,373, which matches the statement.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe statement claims that the Trust received $1,237,548 from EMI, distributed $830,151 to Unit Holders, and had deficiencies totaling $254,373 in 2023. While the amounts received from EMI and the deficiencies are accurate, the amount distributed to Unit Holders is not. The document shows $863,852, not $830,151, was distributed.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

            " To assess the truthfulness of the statement, let's analyze the given financial document:\n\n1. **Investment Portfolio:**\n   The table under [paragraph id = 152] shows the company's fixed-rate Agency RMBS investments as of December 31, 2023. To determine if the company deployed capital into lower coupon Agency RMBS, we need to compare this data with a previous period, which is not provided in the given document. However, we can observe that the company has investments in various coupon rates, including those as low as 2.0% and 2.5%.\n\n2. **Turbulent Market Conditions:**\n   [paragraph id = 60] discusses the potential impact of turbulent market conditions on the liquidity and market value of MBS. It explicitly states that such conditions may negatively impact the liquidity and market value of MBS.\n\n3. **Liquidity:**\n   [paragraph id = 175] shows that the company's liquidity decreased from $632.3 million in 2022 to $453.6 million in 2023, primarily due to cash used for investment purchases and dividends.\n\n4. **Interest Rates:**\n   The document does not explicitly state that rising interest rates are affecting borrowing costs. However, it mentions \"interest rate volatility\" in [paragraph id = 3] and presents different market yields for various coupon rates in the table under [paragraph id = 152].\n\nNow, let's consider the statement:\n- The company may have deployed capital into lower coupon Agency RMBS, but we cannot confirm this without data from a previous period.\n- Turbulent market conditions are indeed mentioned to impact the liquidity of MBS.\n- The company's liquidity decreased, which could be due to deploying capital into investments, among other reasons.\n- The document does not directly discuss rising interest rates affecting borrowing costs.\n\n**Final Determination:**\nSince we cannot confirm that the company deployed capital into lower coupon Agency RMBS (due to insufficient data) and the document does not explicitly discuss rising interest rates affecting borrowing costs, we cannot fully entail the statement. Therefore, the statement is refuted."

In paragraph id=64, the document provides the total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is $1,455,880. However, the document does not provide the total expenses directly. We can calculate the net loss by subtracting the total stockholders' deficit at the beginning of the year from the total stockholders' deficit at the end of the year.\n   In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the total stockholders' deficit as of December 31, 2023, is $(5,267,658), and as of December 31, 2022, it is $(5,119,181). So the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023, is $(5,267,658) - $(5,119,181) = $(148,477), not $1,259,191 as stated.\n\n3. **Negative Cash Flows from Operations:**\n   The document does not provide a direct figure for cash flows from operations. However, we can infer that it is negative from the going concern note mentioned earlier. But we do not have the exact amount to verify the $337,387 mentioned in the statement.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the company does face a going concern issue, but the stated amounts for the net loss and negative cash flows from operations cannot be verified with the given data. Therefore, the statement is refuted."

Let's check the relevant sections of the document.\n\n#### Operating Income Margin\nFrom paragraph id = 321, we observe the operating income data for Family Dollar:\n- Fiscal 2024: Operating loss of $(2,663.5 million)\n- Fiscal 2023: Operating income of $127.5 million\n- Fiscal 2022: Operating income of $543.1 million\n\nThere is a significant decrease in operating income from $543.1 million in 2022 to $127.5 million in 2023, and an operating loss in 2024.\n\n#### Net Sales\nFrom paragraph id = 321, we find the net sales data:\n- Fiscal 2024: $13,811.3 million\n- Fiscal 2023: $12,912.5 million\n- Fiscal 2022: $12,387.7 million\n\nThe increase in net sales from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023 is:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\frac{12,912.5 - 12,387.7}{12,387.7} \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\frac{524.8}{12,387.7} \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Increase} \\approx 4.2\\% \\]\n\n#### Goodwill and Trade Name Impairment Charges\nThe document does not provide direct information about goodwill impairment or trade name impairment charges.\n\n### Step 3: Verifying the Claims Against the Data\n- **Significant Increase in Operating Income Margin**: The data indicates an operating income decrease from $543.1 million to $127.5 million, which is a contradiction.\n- **Goodwill Impairment Charge**: There is no data mentioning a goodwill impairment charge of $1,069.0 million.\n- **Trade Name Impairment Charge**: There is no data mentioning a trade name impairment charge of $950.0 million.\n- **7.0% Increase in Net Sales**: The actual increase is approximately 4.2%.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the given financial document:\n- **Operating income margin decreased significantly**.\n- There is no mention of goodwill impairment or trade name impairment charges.\n- The net sales increase was approximately 4.2%, not 7.0%.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

We need to look for sections in the document that provide information about:\n- The Revolving Credit Facility\n- The company's ability to declare dividends\n- Financial ratio requirements\n- Default conditions\n\n### Step 2: Examine the Revolving Credit Facility\nFrom paragraph [98], it mentions:\n\"25 In addition, our revolving credit facility provides that if an event of default occurs or excess availability under our revolving credit facility drops below a threshold amount equal to the greater of 10% of the Line Cap (as defined in the Amended Agreement) and $35 million (and until such time as excess availability for two consecutive fiscal months exceeds that threshold amount and no event of default has occurred and is continuing), we will be required to maintain a monthly minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0:1.0, determined on a trailing twelve-month basis.\"\n\nThis indicates there are restrictions related to the revolving credit facility, including financial ratio requirements and default conditions.\n\n### Step 3: Check for Borrowings Outstanding\nFrom paragraph [173], it states:\n\"At December 31, 2022, we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility.\"\n\nThis confirms that there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility on December 31, 2022.\n\n### Step 4: Assess Limitations on Declaring Dividends\nParagraph [98] also mentions:\n\"\u2022declare or pay dividends, redeem stock, or make other distributions to stockholders;\"\n\nThis indicates that the ability to declare or pay dividends is subject to certain conditions, including financial ratio requirements and default conditions.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze Financial Ratio Requirements and Default Conditions\nThe financial ratio requirements and default conditions are mentioned in paragraph [98]:\n\"if an event of default occurs or excess availability under our revolving credit facility drops below a threshold amount equal to the greater of 10% of the Line Cap (as defined in the Amended Agreement) and $35 million (and until such time as excess availability for two consecutive fiscal months exceeds that threshold amount and no event of default has occurred and is continuing), we will be required to maintain a monthly minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0:1.0, determined on a trailing twelve-month basis.\"\n\nThis confirms that there are specific financial ratio requirements and conditions related to default that the company must adhere to.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe financial document confirms that despite having no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility on December 31, 2022, the company is limited in its ability to declare dividends under both the Amended Agreement and the indenture governing the 2030 Notes due to financial ratio requirements and default conditions.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

            " To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to analyze specific points mentioned in the statement against the provided financial document:\n\n1. **Decrease in Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses by 18.9%:**\n   - According to the document (paragraph id = 108), the change in Selling, General, and Administrative expenses from 2022 to 2023 in EMEA was -18.9%.\n\n2. **Potential Fall in Operating Margins:**\n   - To assess this, we need to compare the operating profit for 2022 and 2023.\n   - Operating profit in 2023 was $208.7 million, while in 2022 it was $(39.1) million (a loss). This shows a significant increase rather than a potential fall.\n\n3. **Strong Price-to-Cost Ratio to Counter Elevated Freight and Labor Costs:**\n   - This element is subjective and not directly quantifiable from the provided data. We can check the revenue growth and changes in expenses to infer it indirectly.\n   - Revenues in 2023 increased by 16.1% compared to 2022.\n   - Gross profit increased by 81.1%, indicating a strong improvement in the price-to-cost ratio.\n\n### Analysis Steps:\n\n1. **Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses:**\n   - EMEA region shows a decrease of 18.9% in SG&A expenses from $91.6 million in 2022 to $108.9 million in 2023.\n   - Overall, the SG&A expenses decreased by 22.0% from $473.0 million to $576.9 million.\n\n2. **Operating Profit:**\n   - Operating profit in 2023 is $208.7 million.\n   - In 2022, there was an operating loss of $39.1 million.\n   - This shows a substantial improvement rather than a potential fall.\n\n3. **Revenue and Gross Profit Growth:**\n   - Revenues grew from $3,548.3 million in 2022 to $4,118.3 million in 2023, a 16.1% increase.\n   - Gross profit grew from $433.9 million in 2022 to $785.6 million in 2023, an 81.1% increase.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe financial document shows an increase in revenues and gross profits, alongside a decrease in SG&A expenses. The operating profit significantly improved rather than declined. There is no direct mention of currency fluctuations affecting the performance, and the price-to-cost ratio indirectly seems strong given the substantial increase in gross profit.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

Let's break down the statement into its components and address each part separately:\n\n1. **\"23andMe Holding Co. has relied on a significant PIPE investment and merger proceeds to finance operations while incurring ongoing operating losses.\"**\n\n   - The document provides financial performance metrics such as revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, but it does not directly mention PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) investments or merger proceeds. Therefore, based on the provided document, we cannot confirm or refute the reliance on PIPE investments and merger proceeds.\n\n2. **\"and faces potential liquidity challenges partly due to its substantial R&D investments\"**\n\n   - The document shows significant R&D investments under the \"Segment Adjusted EBITDA\" section, with losses in the \"Consumer and Research Services Adjusted EBITDA\" and substantial negative values in the \"Therapeutics Adjusted EBITDA\" and \"Unallocated Corporate\". This indicates significant investments and losses, which could pose liquidity challenges.\n\n3. **\"and the expiration of the GSK Agreement, which did not significantly impact revenue.\"**\n\n   - The document mentions the expiration of the GSK Agreement in July 2023 and notes that substantially all research services revenue was derived from this agreement. However, it does not explicitly state that the expiration did not significantly impact revenue. In fact, it suggests that additional research service agreements may be needed to maintain revenue levels, implying potential impact.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the provided document:\n\n- There is no direct mention of PIPE investments or merger proceeds, so we cannot confirm this part of the statement.\n- The document does show substantial operating losses and investments in R&D, which support the notion of potential liquidity challenges.\n- The document discusses the expiration of the GSK Agreement and hints at its potential impact on revenue, but it does not conclude that the expiration did not significantly impact revenue.\n\nGiven these points, the statement is partially supported, but the lack of information on PIPE investments and the ambiguity regarding the impact of the GSK Agreement's expiration on revenue lead us to conclude that the statement is not fully entailed.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

This indicates a significant improvement in revenues.\n\n2. **Operating Income Analysis:**\n   - **Fiscal 2023 Operating Income:** $33.9 million\n   - **Fiscal 2022 Operating Income:** $8.3 million\n   - **Fiscal 2021 Operating Income:** $(41.5) million\n\n   The operating income in fiscal 2023 improved significantly compared to the operating loss in fiscal 2021 and also showed improvement compared to fiscal 2022.\n\n3. **Expenses Analysis:**\n   - The document does not provide a specific breakdown of corporate expenses related to compensation. However, we can observe the total costs and expenses:\n     - **Fiscal 2023 Total Costs and Expenses:** $695.6 million\n     - **Fiscal 2022 Total Costs and Expenses:** $669.1 million\n     - **Fiscal 2021 Total Costs and Expenses:** $499.7 million\n\n   While the total costs and expenses increased from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023, the operating income still improved, suggesting potential decreases in specific expense categories such as corporate items due to compensation.\n\n4. **Theatre Operations:**\n   - The document does not provide explicit information about the permanent closures of some theatres affecting the results. However, the overall revenue increase suggests that any impact from closures was overshadowed by other factors like the reopening of hotels.\n\nBased on the above analysis:\n- Revenues significantly improved in fiscal 2023.\n- Operating income showed significant improvement.\n- While total costs and expenses increased, operating income still improved, suggesting potential savings in specific expense categories like corporate items due to compensation.\n\nTherefore, the statement is entailed by the provided financial document.\n\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, the statement is entailed."

However, there is no direct mention in the document regarding the effectiveness of the company's disclosure controls and procedures. The financial statements and accompanying notes do not provide explicit information on this aspect. Based on the provided document, whether the disclosure controls and procedures were deemed effective cannot be definitively concluded.\n\n2. **Material Weaknesses**:\n   - The statement mentions material weaknesses, including issues like management domination by a single individual. The financial document does not provide any information on material weaknesses in internal controls, management domination, or related issues. There is no data in the provided snippets to support or refute the presence of these weaknesses.\n\n3. **Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting**:\n   - The statement claims that there have been no changes in internal controls over financial reporting for the three months ended December 31, 2023. This part of the statement can be verified using the document.\n   - From the financial document:\n     - In paragraph id = 62 (under PART II - OTHER INFORMATION):\n       ```\n       There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have occurred for the three months ended December 31, 2023, that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\n       ```\n     - This information directly supports the claim in the statement that there were no changes in internal controls over financial reporting during the specified period.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The statement regarding no changes in internal controls over financial reporting for the three months ended December 31, 2023 is supported by the provided document.\n- However, the claims about the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and the presence of material weaknesses (including management domination by a single individual) cannot be verified or refuted based on the provided document, as it does not contain relevant information on these aspects.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **partially entailed** due to the mention of no changes in internal controls but cannot be fully verified or refuted regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and the presence of material weaknesses.\n\nIf we focus strictly on the verifiable part (no changes in internal controls over financial reporting), then the statement can be considered entailed.

To verify, the FDIC insurance limit can be used, but typically, it is $250,000 per depositor per bank. However, we will assume the provided excess amount is correct for simplicity in this analysis.\n   - The document does not provide direct information on excess bank deposits beyond FDIC limits, so we cannot accurately confirm this part without additional data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven the analysis, the statement about net revenue is accurate, but the percentage of soybean oil sales does not match (46.8% instead of 51%). The excess bank deposits claim cannot be verified from the given data.\n\nTherefore, the statement is partially incorrect based on the provided document.\n\n**Final Determination:**\n\"Therefore, the statement is refuted.\""

[...] Time charters constituted 80% of the Company\u2019s shipping revenues in 2023.\" This confirms that a significant portion of the revenue is driven by fixed rates (time charters).\n\n3. **U.S. Economic Conditions and Competition**:\n   - Paragraph [90]: The document discusses various factors affecting the industry, including \"global and regional economic and political conditions,\" which include \"U.S. economic conditions.\"\n   - Paragraph [90]: The document mentions, \"Increases in the supply of Jones Act vessels without a commensurate increase in demand,\" which indicates competition within the domestic market.\n   - While the document does not explicitly mention competition from other domestic and international transportation options, it does highlight the dynamic and competitive nature of the marine transportation industry overall.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the Company's fleet strategy, as described in the document, involves opportunistic acquisitions and dispositions to enhance invested capital. This strategy aligns with its revenue structure driven by fixed rates and is influenced by economic conditions. While the document does not explicitly discuss competition from other transportation options, it does mention factors that indicate a competitive environment.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

This contradicts the statement that the convertible debt fair value decreased.\n\n#### Part 2: VOXZOGO Revenue Surge\nFrom the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we have the following data on VOXZOGO revenue:\n- **Net Product Revenues for VOXZOGO:**\n  - Three Months Ended March 31, 2024: $152.9 million\n  - Three Months Ended March 31, 2023: $87.8 million\n  - Change: $65.1 million increase\n\nThis data supports that VOXZOGO's revenue surged significantly. However, the document does not provide specific information about the reasons for this surge (e.g., increased patient intake across all regions). Therefore, the statement about the cause of the revenue surge cannot be verified from the provided document.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement that the company's convertible debt fair value decreased is refuted by the provided financial document. While the document confirms a surge in VOXZOGO's revenue, it does not provide sufficient information to confirm the reason for this surge. Therefore, the statement is refuted based on the convertible debt data alone.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

            " To assess the truthfulness of the given statement, we need to analyze the provided financial document carefully. The statement discusses several issues: the adoption of accounting standards, going concern issues, negative financial trends, operating losses, and an accumulated deficit. We need to determine whether these points are entailed or refuted by the financial documents.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Adoption of Critical Accounting Standards (ASC 606 and ASU 2016-13):**\n   - The financial document does not explicitly mention the adoption of ASC 606 or ASU 2016-13. Therefore, we cannot verify this part of the statement based on the provided document.\n\n2. **Going Concern Issues:**\n   - Going concern issues are typically mentioned in the notes to the financial statements if they exist. Since the notes are not fully provided, we cannot directly verify this from the document.\n\n3. **Negative Financial Trends:**\n   - **Net Loss:** The Condensed Statements of Cash Flows show a net loss of $32,348 for the nine months ended December 31, 2023.\n   - **Decrease in Cash:** The same statement shows a net decrease in cash of $5,089 for the same period.\n\n4. **Operating Losses:**\n   - The Condensed Statements of Cash Flows show an operating loss as part of the net cash used in operating activities of $27,427 for the nine months ended December 31, 2023.\n\n5. **Accumulated Deficit:**\n   - The Condensed Balance Sheets show an accumulated deficit of $(472,262) as of December 31, 2023, and $(439,914) as of March 31, 2023.\n   - The Condensed Statements of Changes in Stockholders\u2019 Deficit also reflect an accumulated deficit of $(472,262) as of December 31, 2023.\n\n6. **Shift in Business Focus:**\n   - The document does not mention a shift in business focus to furniture retail.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the provided financial document, the company does show negative financial trends such as operating losses and an accumulated deficit. However, the document does not mention going concern issues, the adoption of specific accounting standards, or a shift in business focus. Therefore, the statement is only partially supported by the document.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is partially refuted.**"

Check if there is a mention of higher sales by Cogent and reduced advertising and stock compensation expenses.\n\nLet's proceed step by step:\n\n1. **Operating Income for January 31, 2024:**\n   - According to the \"CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\" for the three months ended January 31, 2024, the \"Income (loss) from operations\" is $38,356.\n\n2. **Operating Loss for January 31, 2023:**\n   - According to the same document, the \"Income (loss) from operations\" for the three months ended January 31, 2023, is $(133,845).\n\n3. **Reasons for Operating Income Improvement:**\n   - The document does not explicitly state the reasons for the improvement in operating income, such as higher sales by Cogent or reduced advertising and stock compensation expenses. However, we can infer these reasons by comparing the expense figures:\n     - **Advertising Expenses:** Reduced from $96,711 in 2023 to $53,032 in 2024.\n     - **Stock Compensation:** Reduced from $52,283 in 2023 to $19,889 in 2024.\n     - **Revenue Increase:** Revenue increased from $492,119 in 2023 to $630,536 in 2024.\n\nAnalysis:\n- The financial document confirms the operating income of $38,356 for January 31, 2024, and the operating loss of $(133,845) for January 31, 2023.\n- The document also shows a significant decrease in advertising and stock compensation expenses, alongside an increase in revenue.\n\nWhile the document provides numerical evidence supporting the statement, it does not explicitly mention \"higher sales by Cogent.\" However, since the revenue increase is evident, and it's common for increased sales to contribute to improved operating income, we can infer that the statement is largely supported by the given data, with the exception of the explicit mention of Cogent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTherefore, the statement is generally entailed by the provided financial document, despite not explicitly mentioning higher sales by Cogent.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

            " To determine whether the statement is entailed or refuted, we need to analyze the provided financial document step by step:\n\n1. **Net Revenue Increase for the Six Months Ended March 31, 2024:**\n   - According to the document, the net revenue for the six months ended March 31, 2024, was $17,409 million, while for the same period in 2023, it was $15,921 million.\n   - To calculate the percentage increase: \\((17409 - 15921) / 15921 \\times 100\\).\n   - Percentage increase = \\(1488 / 15921 \\times 100 \\approx 9.35\\%\\).\n\n2. **Growth in Processed Transactions:**\n   - The statement mentions a 10% growth in processed transactions. However, the document does not provide specific data on the number of processed transactions or their growth rate. Hence, we cannot confirm this part of the statement based on the provided document.\n\n3. **Goodwill Increase Due to Acquisition of Pismo Holdings:**\n   - According to the balance sheet, goodwill as of March 31, 2024, was $18,837 million, and as of September 30, 2023, it was $17,997 million.\n   - The increase in goodwill = \\(18837 - 17997 = 840\\) million.\n   - However, the document does not explicitly mention Pismo Holdings or the reason for the goodwill increase.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The statement about the net revenue increase is supported by the document (approximately 9.35% increase).\n- The statement about the 10% growth in processed transactions cannot be confirmed due to lack of specific data in the document.\n- The increase in goodwill is close to the mentioned $790 million, but the document does not attribute this increase to the acquisition of Pismo Holdings.\n\nTherefore, the statement is partially supported but lacks conclusive evidence for the processed transactions and the specific attribution of goodwill increase. Overall, the statement is **refuted** based on the available data."

From the balance sheet, we have the following information:\n\n- December 31, 2023:\n  - Current assets: $33,388,000\n  - Current liabilities: $28,397,000\n  - Working capital: $33,388,000 - $28,397,000 = $4,991,000\n\n- June 30, 2023:\n  - Current assets: $30,942,000\n  - Current liabilities: $23,830,000\n  - Working capital: $30,942,000 - $23,830,000 = $7,112,000\n\n**Analysis:**\n- There is a decrease in working capital from June 30, 2023, to December 31, 2023 ($7,112,000 to $4,991,000).\n- This decrease suggests an increase in working capital requirements, which implies more cash outflows.\n\n### Step 3: Interest Expenses and Their Impact on Cash Flows\n\nThe document provides the following information on interest expenses:\n\n- Six months ended December 31, 2023: Interest expense = $(852,000)\n- Six months ended December 31, 2022: Interest expense = $(713,000)\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The interest expense for the six months ended December 31, 2023 is higher than the interest expense for the same period in 2022 (i.e., $852,000 > $713,000).\n- This indicates an increase in interest expenses, which implies more cash outflows.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe statement claims that despite an improvement in net loss for the six months ended December 31, 2023, the company continued to experience negative cash flows from operations, driven primarily by increases in working capital requirements and interest expenses.\n\n- **Net loss improvement:** Confirmed from the financial data.\n- **Increase in working capital requirements:** Confirmed from the decrease in working capital.\n- **Increase in interest expenses:** Confirmed from the financial data.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed** by the financial document.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

This indicates that there were no production costs incurred during that year. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that the Hycroft Mine segment constitutes 100% of production costs.\n\n2. **Safety Milestones**:\n   The statement mentions that the Hycroft Mine has achieved significant safety milestones. However, the provided document does not offer any information about safety milestones or achievements. Therefore, this part of the statement cannot be verified based on the given document.\n\n3. **Mining Lease Obligations and Environmental Regulations**:\n   The statement highlights challenges with mining lease obligations and environmental regulations.

These points support the statement's claim that the company faces challenges related to mining lease obligations and environmental regulations.\n\nBased on the provided document, we can conclude that:\n- The claim about production costs is refuted.\n- The claim about safety milestones cannot be verified.\n- The claim about challenges with mining lease obligations and environmental regulations is entailed.\n\n**Final determination**: The statement is refuted, as the claim about production costs is not supported by the provided document."

            " 1. **Reading the context and the statement**: The given financial document provides information about the company's revenue, expansion plans, risks, and challenges related to manufacturing processes. The statement discusses the importance of transitioning to 200mm substrates for cost management and highlights challenges like supply chain limitations and significant fixed costs.\n\n2. **Analyzing relevant data**:\n\n   - **Transition to 200mm substrates**:\n     - Paragraph [219] mentions, \"our ability to convert volume manufacturing to larger diameter substrates can be an important factor in providing a more cost-effective manufacturing process.\" This supports the statement's claim about the importance of transitioning to 200mm substrates for cost management.\n\n   - **Supply chain limitations**:\n     - Paragraph [219] also lists \"lack of consistency and adequate quality and quantity of piece parts, other raw materials and other bill of materials items\" as a factor that could impact yields. This can imply supply chain limitations, although it doesn't explicitly mention sole and limited source suppliers.\n\n   - **Significant fixed costs**:\n     - The document does not explicitly discuss significant fixed costs related to the transition to 200mm substrates. However, paragraph [214] mentions multiple expansion projects, which implies substantial capital expenditures (a type of fixed cost). Additionally, paragraph [218] discusses risks associated with cost overruns in construction projects.\n\n3. **Reasoning**:\n   - The document supports the claim that transitioning to 200mm substrates is crucial for cost management.\n   - While the document hints at supply chain issues, it does not explicitly mention challenges from sole and limited source suppliers as highlighted in the statement.\n   - Significant fixed costs are implied through discussions on expansion projects and related risks but are not explicitly tied to the transition to 200mm substrates.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The statement is not entirely supported by the document because while it accurately reflects some aspects (importance of transitioning to 200mm substrates), it also contains elements not explicitly mentioned in the document (specific supply chain limitations and explicit significant fixed costs tied to the transition). Therefore, the statement is refuted."

Therefore, we should look for sections discussing these topics.\n\n2. **Review Paragraph 106:**\n   - Paragraph 106 states: \"The personal and financial interests of our directors and officers may influence their motivation in timely identifying and selecting a target business and completing a business combination. Consequently, our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 discretion in identifying and selecting a suitable target business may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether the terms, conditions, and timing of a particular business combination are appropriate and in our shareholders\u2019 best interest.\"\n   - This paragraph directly addresses the concerns raised in the statement regarding potential conflicts of interest due to personal and financial interests.\n\n3. **Review Paragraph 26:**\n   - Paragraph 26 discusses the company\u2019s financial position and options for utilizing funds, but it does not mention potential conflicts of interest due to sponsor involvement in shareholding or warrant holdings.\n\n4. **Review Paragraph 38:**\n   - Paragraph 38 discusses limited ability to evaluate the target\u2019s management, but it does not discuss conflicts of interest related to personal and financial interests or sponsor involvement.\n\n5. **Review Paragraph 115 and 119:**\n   - Paragraphs 115 and 119 discuss risks associated with the target business but do not discuss conflicts of interest related to personal and financial interests or sponsor involvement.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the review of the financial document, the most relevant information is found in Paragraph 106. This paragraph confirms that the personal and financial interests of directors and officers may influence their decisions and potentially result in conflicts of interest. The document does not explicitly mention sponsor involvement in shareholding and warrant holdings, but it does address the general concern about conflicts of interest arising from personal and financial interests.\n\nTherefore, the statement is entailed by the financial document.\n\n**Final Determination:**\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

Strategic positioning to capitalize on changes in the uranium market driven by geopolitical shifts\n\nLet's go through each point step-by-step:\n\n1. **Acquisition of Black Range Minerals:**\n   - The document does not mention anything about the acquisition of Black Range Minerals. There is no explicit information in the provided context that discusses this acquisition.\n\n2. **Development of Kinetic Separation technology:**\n   - The document discusses plans to \"secure regulatory approval licenses to fully utilize our Kinetic Separation\" and to \"incorporate Kinetic Separation in the processing uranium and vanadium bearing materials.\" (Paragraph 301)\n   - Additionally, the document mentions \"Kinetic Separation intellectual property\" under property, plant & equipment details, indicating that the company has some investment in this technology. (Paragraph 398)\n\n3. **Legislative efforts to sustain domestic uranium production:**\n   - The document does not explicitly mention any legislative efforts to sustain domestic uranium production. It focuses more on the company's internal plans and financial situation.\n\n4. **Strategic positioning to capitalize on changes in the uranium market driven by geopolitical shifts:**\n   - The document mentions plans to construct a processing plant and use Kinetic Separation technology, suggesting some strategic positioning. However, it does not discuss geopolitical shifts or how the company is strategically positioned to capitalize on them.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the provided financial document:\n- There is no mention of the acquisition of Black Range Minerals.\n- The development of Kinetic Separation technology is mentioned.\n- There is no discussion of legislative efforts to sustain domestic uranium production.\n- There is no explicit discussion of strategic positioning related to geopolitical shifts.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

Check if the increase was driven primarily by higher sales and an increased gross margin rate (although gross margin rate is not directly mentioned in the provided document).\n\nLet's analyze the document:\n\n1. In paragraph id = 267, we can find the Net income for the fiscal years ended February 3, 2024 (which is referred to as Fiscal 2023 in the statement) and January 28, 2023 (Fiscal 2022).\n   - Net income for Fiscal 2023: $339,649,000\n   - Net income for Fiscal 2022: $230,123,000\n\n2. The difference in Net income between Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022 is:\n   - $339,649,000 - $230,123,000 = $109,526,000 (or $109.5 million)\n\n3. The statement mentions Adjusted Net Income, but the document only provides Net income figures. Since no adjustments are mentioned in the document, we cannot accurately calculate or verify the Adjusted Net Income.\n\nBased on the provided document, the Net income for Fiscal 2023 did increase, but by $109.5 million (not $112.6 million), and the Net income for Fiscal 2023 is $339.6 million (not $393.4 million). The document does not provide enough information to determine if the increase was driven primarily by higher sales and an increased gross margin rate.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

It lists operating expenses, interest expense, and other financial metrics without clarifying if they are recurring or non-recurring.\n\n3. **Check for Mentions of Trade Secrets or Confidentiality Agreements:**\n    - Neither the proprietary features section nor the financial statements explicitly mention trade secrets or confidentiality agreements.\n\n4. **Analyze Potential Future Benefits:**\n    - The document provides revenue details for subscriptions and other revenues.

            " To verify the given statement, we need to check the following points in the provided financial document:\n\n1. Whether there was a tax benefit due to the release of a valuation allowance.\n2. The amount of the tax benefit.\n3. The impact on the effective corporate tax rate.\n\nLet's analyze the document step by step:\n\n1. **Release of Valuation Allowance**: Paragraph 242 mentions, \"...a full release of its federal valuation allowance, and state valuation allowance...\". This confirms that there was a release of valuation allowance.\n\n2. **Amount of Tax Benefit**: To find the amount of the tax benefit, we need to look at the change in the valuation allowance. Paragraph 242 states, \"The net change in the valuation allowance from December 31, 2022 was $4.6 million\". This seems to contradict the statement, as the mentioned tax benefit is $4,002,660. However, let's calculate the impact of this change on the tax provision to be sure.\n\n   In the \"Reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income\" table, the \"Income tax (benefit) provision\" for 2023 is $(4,094,911). This is a negative value, indicating a tax benefit. To find the impact of the valuation allowance release, we can subtract the net change in the valuation allowance from the tax benefit:\n\n   $4,094,911 (tax benefit) - $4,600,000 (change in valuation allowance) = $(505,089)\n\n   This result suggests that, without the valuation allowance release, the company would have had a tax expense of approximately $505,089. The actual tax benefit was approximately $4,094,911, not $4,002,660.\n\n3. **Impact on Effective Corporate Tax Rate**: The effective tax rate can be calculated as follows:\n\n   Effective Tax Rate = (Income Tax (Benefit) Provision / Income Before Income Tax Provision) * 100\n\n   Using the provided data:\n\n   Effective Tax Rate = ($(4,094,911) / $2,363,816) * 100 \u2248 -173.2%\n\n   This matches the statement's claim of a negative rate of 173.2%.\n\nBased on our analysis, the company did report a tax benefit due to the release of a valuation allowance, and it significantly impacted the effective corporate tax rate, resulting in a negative rate of 173.2%. However, the amount of the tax benefit was not $4,002,660 but approximately $4,094,911. Therefore, the statement is refuted."

            " 1. **Revenue Change Analysis**:\n   - We need to verify if the total revenues per Average WSE (Work-Site Employee) have remained flat. According to the document, Total revenues for Q1 2024 were $1,264 million, and for Q1 2023 were $1,246 million. The percent change in revenue is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percent Change} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue Q1 2024} - \\text{Total Revenue Q1 2023}}{\\text{Total Revenue Q1 2023}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{1,264 - 1,246}{1,246} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 1.44\\%\n     \\]\n   - Average WSEs for Q1 2024 were 348,164 and for Q1 2023 were 327,107. The percent change in Average WSE is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percent Change} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Average WSE Q1 2024} - \\text{Average WSE Q1 2023}}{\\text{Average WSE Q1 2023}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{348,164 - 327,107}{327,107} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 6.44\\%\n     \\]\n   - To check if the total revenues per Average WSE remained flat, calculate the revenue per Average WSE for both periods:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Revenue per Average WSE Q1 2024} = \\frac{1,264}{348,164} \\approx 0.00363\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Revenue per Average WSE Q1 2023} = \\frac{1,246}{327,107} \\approx 0.00381\n     \\]\n     - The revenue per Average WSE has slightly decreased by about 4.72%, despite the overall revenue slightly increasing.\n\n2. **Net Income Change**:\n   - The statement claims a 31% decrease in net income. The document shows net income for Q1 2024 as $91 million and for Q1 2023 as $131 million. The percent change in net income is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percent Change} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Income Q1 2024} - \\text{Net Income Q1 2023}}{\\text{Net Income Q1 2023}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{91 - 131}{131} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx -30.53\\%\n     \\]\n   - This calculation approximately aligns with the stated 31% decrease.\n\n3. **Growth in Average and Total WSEs**:\n   - The statement claims that Average WSEs grew by 6% and Total WSEs grew by 7%.\n   - The change in Average WSEs is already calculated above at about 6.44%.\n   - For Total WSEs, the values are given as 351,919 for Q1 2024 and 328,299 for Q1 2023. The percent change is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Percent Change} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Total WSE Q1 2024} - \\text{Total WSE Q1 2023}}{\\text{Total WSE Q1 2023}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{351,919 - 328,299}{328,299} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 7.21\\%\n     \\]\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the statement is factually correct in terms of the percent changes in net income and the growth in Average and Total WSEs.

However, it does not explicitly mention data for 2021.\n- For 2022, QVC International's Adjusted OIBDA is $358 million.\n- For 2023, QVC International's Adjusted OIBDA is $325 million.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- The document does not provide information on how foreign currency fluctuations specifically affected QVC's Adjusted OIBDA across the years, nor does it mention the year 2021.\n- Therefore, we cannot directly verify the impact of currency fluctuations on QVC's Adjusted OIBDA based on the provided data.\n\n### Point 2: Managing Interest Rate Risks Using Derivatives\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The document provides information on Qurate Retail's debt structure, including both variable rate debt and fixed rate debt.\n- It mentions the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates for variable and fixed rate debts for QxH and QVC International, as well as corporate and other entities.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- There is no explicit mention of the use of derivatives to manage interest rate risks in the document.\n- The document details the debt structure but does not provide information on any risk management strategies, such as the use of derivatives to offset variations in interest rates.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the provided financial document, there is no direct evidence to support the claim that Qurate Retail experiences potential economic losses due to foreign currency fluctuations impacting QVC's Adjusted OIBDA from 2021 to 2023. Additionally, the document does not mention the use of derivatives to manage interest rate risks.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Sections**:\n   - We look for paragraphs or sections that mention the submission of documents, especially the financial disclosures and any certifications associated with them.\n\n2. **Review Paragraph 368**:\n   - Paragraph 368 lists the signatures of various individuals, including Timothy Hwang (Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and Director) and Jon Slabaugh (Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer), dated March 14, 2024. This section indicates that the signatories are certifying the report.\n\n3. **Check for XBRL Mention**:\n   - The document does not explicitly mention \"Inline XBRL Instance Document.\" However, the presence of consolidated balance sheets and other financial information strongly suggests the use of XBRL for electronic filing, as it is common practice.\n\n4. **Review Other Sections**:\n   - Paragraph 364 mentions \"Exhibits\" and how some of them are incorporated by reference. While it does not explicitly mention XBRL, the detailed nature of the exhibits and their inclusion in the Annual Report on Form 10-K implies the use of XBRL for structured data reporting.\n\n5. **Assess the Context**:\n   - Given the context of a financial report filed with the SEC, it is standard practice for companies to submit their financial disclosures in XBRL format. The signatures of the CEO and CFO certify the accuracy of the financial statements, which are typically submitted electronically.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the standard practices for financial reporting and the certifications provided by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in the document, it is reasonable to infer that the Inline XBRL Instance Document was submitted electronically.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

However, there is no specific information in the provided document indicating which portion of the total assets secures the term loan.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - While the numerical figures related to the term loan amount and its components match, the document does not provide explicit details on the book value of the assets securing the term loan. Therefore, we cannot confirm the asset-related part of the statement based on the provided document.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed regarding the term loan amount, but it cannot be confirmed regarding the securing assets.

For 2023, the amount is $45,314 thousand, and for 2022, it is $41,453 thousand.\n   - There is no direct mention of a cumulative $192.9 million in net operating loss carryforwards. However, the amounts listed are in thousands, so $45,314 thousand for 2023 translates to $45.314 million.\n\n2. **Cumulative Losses and Utilization Limits**:\n   - The statement mentions cumulative losses of $48.0 million over the last three years. We need to check if the document mentions such cumulative losses.\n   - The document does not directly report cumulative losses over a three-year period in the provided sections. However, it does report an accumulated deficit of -$326,806 thousand (or -$326.806 million) for 2023 and -$351,519 thousand (or -$351.519 million) for 2022 under stockholders' equity.\n\n3. **Section 382 and Utilization Limits**:\n   - The statement mentions limitations under Section 382, allowing only an annual utilization of $3.5 million plus an uplift of $24.5 million due to an ownership change in 2023.\n   - The document does not provide explicit information about Section 382 limitations or the specific utilization amounts mentioned in the statement.\n\nBased on the provided financial document, we can conclude the following:\n\n- The document reports deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards but does not directly support the cumulative loss amount of $48.0 million or the specific limitations under Section 382.\n- The amounts for net operating loss carryforwards are $45.314 million for 2023 and $41.453 million for 2022, which do not sum up to $192.9 million.\n- The document lacks specific details on annual utilization limitations under Section 382.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

            " To verify the statement, we need to focus on the financial data related to the Sensors segment for the year 2023. Here\u2019s how we can analyze the information provided:\n\n1. **Sequential Increase in Net Revenues:**\n   - The financial document provides quarterly net revenues for the Sensors segment.\n   - Net revenues for the Sensors segment in each quarter are as follows:\n     - 1st Quarter 2023: $36,726\n     - 2nd Quarter 2023: $36,266\n     - 3rd Quarter 2023: $32,532\n     - 4th Quarter 2023: $34,259\n   - We need to check if there is a sequential increase. A sequential increase would mean each quarter's revenue is higher than the previous quarter\u2019s.\n   - From 1st Quarter to 2nd Quarter:\n     - Net revenues decreased from $36,726 to $36,266.\n   - From 2nd Quarter to 3rd Quarter:\n     - Net revenues further decreased from $36,266 to $32,532.\n   - From 3rd Quarter to 4th Quarter:\n     - Net revenues increased from $32,532 to $34,259.\n   - Based on the data, the net revenues did not experience a consistent sequential increase throughout 2023. There was a decrease in the 2nd and 3rd quarters followed by a slight increase in the 4th quarter.\n\n2. **Year-over-Year Revenue Decreases (YoY):**\n   - To determine year-over-year changes, we need to compare the annual net revenues for the Sensors segment.\n   - Unfortunately, the document does not provide the annual net revenues for 2023 directly. However, we have the year-end numbers for 2022 and previous years, but not a combined annual figure for 2023.\n\n3. **Precision Resistor Sales, AMS, and General Industrial Markets, and Competition:**\n   - The given data does not provide specific details about precision resistor sales, AMS (Advanced Manufacturing Services), General Industrial markets, or information about market competition.\n\nGiven the provided data, we can definitively state:\n- The net revenues for the Sensors segment did not experience a consistent sequential increase throughout 2023.\n- The data does not include information to verify year-over-year revenue decreases, precision resistor sales, AMS, General Industrial markets, or market competition.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe statement is refuted based on the sequential net revenue data available in the document. The other aspects of the statement lack sufficient data for verification.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

            " To verify the given statement, we need to check each assertion against the provided financial document. The statement consists of multiple parts, so let's break it down:\n\n1. **Ownership Changes and IRC Section 382 Impact:**\n   The statement claims that Blade Air Mobility, Inc. underwent multiple ownership changes as defined by IRC Section 382, affecting the future utilization of their US federal net operating loss carryforwards. This information is not directly provided in the document. To verify this, we would need additional information about ownership changes and the application of IRC Section 382.\n\n2. **Net Operating Loss Carryforwards:**\n   The statement mentions that out of $79,737 total, only $3,858 of net operating loss carryforwards is subjected to limitation. The document does not provide explicit details about net operating loss carryforwards or their limitations.\n\n3. **Net Loss Booked for 2023:**\n   The statement indicates that the company booked a net loss of $56,076. We can verify this by checking the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity and other relevant sections.\n\n4. **Total Potentially Dilutive Securities:**\n   The statement claims that the company had total potentially dilutive securities of 26,643,700 at the end of 2023. This information is not directly provided in the document.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant sections of the document to verify the parts we can:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Net Loss Booked for 2023:**\n   - The document provides the following information in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity for the net loss:\n     ```\n     Net loss | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | (56,076) | (56,076)\n     ```\n     This matches the statement's claim that the company booked a net loss of $56,076 for 2023.\n\n2. **Total Potentially Dilutive Securities:**\n   - The document does not explicitly mention the total potentially dilutive securities. We would need additional information to verify this part.\n\n3. **Ownership Changes and IRC Section 382 Impact:**\n   - The document does not provide details about ownership changes or the impact of IRC Section 382 on net operating loss carryforwards. Additional information would be required to verify this part.\n\n4. **Net Operating Loss Carryforwards:**\n   - The document does not provide details about the total net operating loss carryforwards or the amount subjected to limitation. Additional information would be required to verify this part.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the provided financial document, we can only verify the net loss booked for 2023. The document does not provide sufficient information to verify the claims about ownership changes, IRC Section 382 impact, net operating loss carryforwards, or total potentially dilutive securities.\n\nTherefore, the statement is partially refuted based on the available information.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

However, it does not explicitly state recurring losses.\n\n2. **Securing Additional Funding:**\n   - Paragraphs 33 and 35 list various risks including \"Continued access to working capital funds\" and \"Other difficulties in the assimilation of acquired companies and businesses operations, technologies, products and systems.\" These imply challenges in securing funding but do not explicitly mention recurring losses.\n   - Paragraph 84 details the company\u2019s efforts to raise capital through different offerings, which indicates attempts to secure additional funding.\n\n3. **Economic Fluctuations:**\n   - Paragraph 33 mentions \"Fluctuations in and unpredictability of our sales cycle,\" which aligns with economic fluctuations.\n   - The document doesn't directly mention economic fluctuations beyond this.\n\n4. **Evolving Privacy Regulations:**\n   - Paragraph 29 discusses cybersecurity risks and potential legal claims or proceedings due to security breaches, which could imply vulnerability to evolving privacy regulations.\n   - Paragraph 30 mentions infrastructure changes and capacity constraints that could also be impacted by rapidly evolving regulations.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of Each Point\n\n1. **Recurring Losses:**\n   - The document does not directly state that the company is facing recurring losses. While it mentions potential disruptions and financial impacts, there is no explicit mention of sustained losses.\n\n2. **Securing Additional Funding:**\n   - The document includes references to the company\u2019s efforts to raise capital and the risks associated with securing funding. This aligns with the statement.\n\n3. **Economic Fluctuations:**\n   - The document mentions sales cycle fluctuations, which can be tied to economic conditions.\n\n4. **Evolving Privacy Regulations:**\n   - The document discusses cybersecurity risks and potential legal implications, which indirectly relate to evolving privacy regulations.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nThe statement claims that the company faces challenges due to recurring losses, which is not explicitly supported by the document. However, the statement about securing additional funding, economic fluctuations, and evolving privacy regulations is supported by the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** because the document does not provide evidence of the company facing challenges due to recurring losses.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

We can calculate the percentage decrease using the data provided in the document.\n\nFrom the document, we have:\n- Operating income for the six months ended December 31, 2022: $76,719\n- Operating income for the six months ended December 31, 2023: $40,039\n\nTo calculate the percentage decrease:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Decrease} = \\frac{\\text{Old Value} - \\text{New Value}}{\\text{Old Value}} \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Decrease} = \\frac{76,719 - 40,039}{76,719} \\times 100 \\approx 47.8\\% \\]\n\n2. **Wholesale Written Orders**: The statement mentions a 13.7% decline in wholesale written orders. However, the provided document does not contain explicit information about written orders. It only provides data on wholesale sales to external customers.\n\nTo proceed, we need to check if there's any indication of a decline in wholesale sales that might correlate with the mentioned decline in written orders.\n\nFrom the document, we have:\n- Wholesale sales to external customers for the six months ended December 31, 2022: $62,270\n- Wholesale sales to external customers for the six months ended December 31, 2023: $58,370\n\nTo calculate the percentage decrease:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Decrease} = \\frac{62,270 - 58,370}{62,270} \\times 100 \\approx 6.26\\% \\]\n\nThe calculated decrease in wholesale sales to external customers is approximately 6.26%, which does not match the 13.7% decline in wholesale written orders mentioned in the statement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement mentions a 47.8% decrease in consolidated operating income, which is accurate based on the provided data. However, the statement also mentions a 13.7% decline in wholesale written orders, which cannot be directly verified with the given data, as the document does not explicitly provide information on written orders.

Increase in FVA Segment Revenues:\nWe can verify this by checking the revenues by segment section in the provided document.\n\n- Look for the \"Financial and Valuation Advisory\" segment under the revenue details for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and compare it with the same period in 2022.\n\nFrom the document:\n- FVA segment revenue in 2023: $72,053 thousand\n- FVA segment revenue in 2022: $65,946 thousand\n\nCalculate the percentage increase:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{72,053 - 65,946}{65,946} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{6,107}{65,946} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 9.26\\% \\]\n\nThe document states a 9% increase, and our calculation roughly confirms this percentage.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the financial document does not include the Cash Flow Statement, we cannot verify the $103.1 million net inflow from operating activities. However, we can confirm the 9% increase in FVA segment revenues.\n\nTherefore, the statement is partially supported but cannot be fully confirmed due to the absence of cash flow data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** regarding the net inflow from operating activities but **entailed** regarding the increase in FVA segment revenues."

However, the financial document provided covers the period up to November 30, 2023, and does not include data for 2024.\n\n2. **Collections of Accounts Receivable:**\n   - The document shows accounts receivable of $59,860 as of November 30, 2023, compared to $81,935 as of August 31, 2023. This indicates a significant decrease in accounts receivable, which could suggest strong collections.\n\n3. **Working Capital Changes:**\n   - The statement mentions favorable working capital changes. Working capital is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities.\n   - Current assets as of November 30, 2023: $117,242\n   - Current assets as of August 31, 2023: $145,017\n   - Current liabilities as of November 30, 2023: $134,686\n   - Current liabilities as of August 31, 2023: $151,649\n   - Working capital as of November 30, 2023: $117,242 - $134,686 = -$17,444\n   - Working capital as of August 31, 2023: $145,017 - $151,649 = -$6,632\n   - The working capital decreased from -$6,632 to -$17,444, which is not a favorable change.\n\n4. **Cash and Cash Equivalents:**\n   - The statement mentions a drop to $33.9 million. The document shows cash and cash equivalents of $33,959 as of November 30, 2023, which matches the statement.\n\n5. **Purchase of Common Stock:**\n   - The document shows purchases of common shares for treasury of $16,308, which matches the statement's mention of purchasing $16.3 million of common stock.\n\n6. **Borrowings:**\n   - The document does not explicitly mention the line of credit or borrowings.

            " To verify the statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided financial document and cross-check the figures related to revenues, net loss, and the reasons cited for the net loss.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Revenue Decline\n\nFrom [paragraph id = 93], we see the comparison of revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022:\n\n- **2023 Revenue:** $46\n- **2022 Revenue:** $32,650\n- **Variance:** (32,604)\n- **Percentage Change:** (99.86%)\n\nThis confirms the statement that there was a significant decline in revenue, specifically a 99.86% decrease.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Net Loss\n\nFrom [paragraph id = 106], it is mentioned that:\n\n- **Net loss for the six months ended December 31, 2023:** $627,911 (from the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity)\n\nHowever, the statement specifically mentions the net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2023. Unfortunately, the document does not directly provide the net loss for just this three-month period. We need to infer this from the six-month figures.\n\nFrom [paragraph id = 83], we see the net (loss)/income for the six months ended December 31, 2023:\n\n- **Net (loss)/income for six months ended December 31, 2023:** ($627,911)\n\nGiven that the statement refers to the three-month period and we do not have the exact distribution of the net loss over the quarters, we cannot accurately confirm the $445,557 net loss mentioned in the statement.\n\n### Step 3: Verify Reasons for the Net Loss\n\nThe statement mentions:\n\n- **High operating expenses**\n- **Complete halt of production at Humankind**\n- **Currency translation adjustments on comprehensive income**\n\nFrom [paragraph id = 83], we see:\n\n- **Operating expenses (Depreciation and amortization) for the six months ended December 31, 2023:** $177,456\n- **Comprehensive income (other comprehensive loss - translation adjustment):** $(36,081)\n\nWhile these figures support the idea of high operating expenses and currency translation adjustments, the document does not explicitly mention a complete halt of production at Humankind.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the provided document:\n\n- The revenue decline of 99.86% for the three months ended December 31, 2023, is accurate.\n- The net loss figure for the three-month period specified in the statement ($445,557) cannot be directly verified from the document as it only provides six-month data.\n- The reasons cited for the net loss (high operating expenses and currency translation adjustments) are supported, but the halt of production at Humankind is not explicitly mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** because the net loss figure for the specified three-month period cannot be accurately verified from the given financial document."

To verify this, we would typically look for a section in the financial report that discusses internal control assessments, often titled \"Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\" or something similar.\n   - The document provided does not include any explicit section discussing the assessment of internal controls or identifying material weaknesses.\n\n2. **Changes in Internal Controls**:\n   - The statement asserts that there were no changes in internal controls during the recent quarter. Information about changes in internal controls might be found in disclosure notes or management discussion and analysis (MD&A) sections, which are not included in the provided document.\n\n3. **Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**:\n   - The statement mentions no off-balance sheet arrangements impacting the financial condition. This would typically be discussed in the notes to the financial statements under \"Commitments and Contingencies\" or in the MD&A.\n   - The provided document states under \"Commitments and Contingencies\" that there are no commitments or contingencies, which aligns with the statement that there are no off-balance sheet arrangements.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe financial document provided does not contain any explicit section or statement addressing material weaknesses in internal control or changes in internal controls.

Cost of Sales Increase\n\nLooking at the \"Consolidated Statements of Operations\" for the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2023:\n\n- **Cost of revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2023:** $1,413,414\n- **Cost of revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2023:** $2,230,805\n- **Cost of revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022:** $825\n- **Cost of revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2022:** $825\n\nThere is a significant increase in cost of revenues from 2022 to 2023. This aligns with the statement that the cost of sales increased due to the development and release of new products.\n\n### 2. General and Administrative Expenses\n\nLooking again at the \"Consolidated Statements of Operations\" for the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2023:\n\n- **General and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2023:** $1,496,708\n- **General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2023:** $2,012,669\n- **General and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022:** $5,599\n- **General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2022:** $161,540\n\nFor the year 2023, general and administrative expenses are significantly higher than in 2022. However, the statement mentions $1,492,651, which is very close but not exactly matching the provided figures. This could be due to a rounding error or a minor discrepancy.\n\nConsidering these points, the statement mentions increases that are aligned with the data in the document, but the exact figures for general and administrative expenses do not perfectly match. However, given the closeness of the figures and the context, we can reasonably conclude that the statement is generally supported by the document.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

Analyzing the document for relevant financial data or facts:**\n\n- **Paragraph id = 56:** Discusses the general risks associated with continuing operations and the dependence on market prices of uranium and vanadium.\n- **Paragraph id = 71:** Lists various risks related to mining activities, including external factors like geological formations, permitting issues, and labor availability, but does not mention issues related to geopolitical instability affecting uranium supply from specific countries like Niger.\n- **Paragraph id = 271:** Elaborates on nuclear fuel supply chain risks, particularly those related to Russia and Kazakhstan. It mentions Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the potential influence on Kazakhstan, but there is no mention of Niger.\n- **Paragraph id = 301:** Describes the need for additional financing to continue operations and the plans to secure funds through debt and equity financings.\n- **Financial Statement (Paragraph id = 359):** Shows the financial performance with significant losses, indicating potential financial struggles.\n\n**3. Documenting the reasoning process:**\n\n- **Geopolitical Instability Affecting Uranium Supply from Niger:**\n  - The document extensively discusses geopolitical risks related to Russia and Kazakhstan (Paragraph id = 271), but there is no mention of Niger or any direct risks related to uranium supply from Niger.\n  - The statement claims risks due to geopolitical instability affecting the uranium supply from Niger, which is not supported by the provided document.\n\n- **Uncertainty in Securing Additional Capital for Ongoing Operations:**\n  - Paragraph id = 56 and Paragraph id = 301 highlight the company's need to secure additional financing to continue operations and pay obligations.\n  - The financial statement shows significant losses, which supports the need for additional capital.\n  - The statement correctly identifies the uncertainty in securing additional capital for ongoing operations.\n\n**4. Concluding the analysis:**\n\n- There is no mention of Niger or risks related to uranium supply from Niger in the document.\n- The statement about uncertainty in securing additional capital is correct and supported by the document.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

The company maintained internal controls over financial reporting, with an unqualified opinion from an independent registered public accounting firm.\n\nLet's analyze each point:\n\n### 1. Comprehensive Loss in 2023\n\n**Paragraph [88] contains income and expense details**:\n- **Income from discontinued operations, net of tax**: $5,642\n\nSince the document does not provide an explicit comprehensive loss figure, we need to consider the components of net income:\n- **Sales**: $89,950\n- **Cost of goods sold**: $-56,980\n- **Selling, general and administrative**: $-11,639\n- **Restructuring charges**: $-47\n- **Transaction costs**: $-2,162\n- **Interest expense, net**: $-11,437\n- **Other, net**: $-19\n- **Income from discontinued operations before taxes**: $7,666\n- **Income tax expense**: $-2,024\n\nCalculating net income:\n\\[ 89,950 - 56,980 - 11,639 - 47 - 2,162 - 11,437 - 19 + 7,666 - 2,024 = -12,792 \\]\n\nNet income for 2023 is $-12,792.\n\n### 2. Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment Gain\n\n**Paragraph [90] mentions foreign currency impact**:\n- **Impact of foreign currency exchange rates**: $126\n\nThis is the only mentioned impact of foreign currency, and it's positive, suggesting a gain and not a significant component.\n\n### 3. Internal Controls and Auditor's Opinion\n\nThe statement mentions \"maintaining internal controls over financial reporting\" and an \"unqualified opinion from the independent registered public accounting firm.\" However, the provided text does not explicitly state the auditor's opinion or discuss internal controls.\n\n### Analysis and Conclusion\n\nGiven the provided financial data:\n1. The net loss for 2023 is indeed negative ($-12,792).\n2. The foreign currency translation adjustment is positive but minimal ($126), not the mentioned $2,405.\n3. There is no explicit mention of internal controls or the auditor's opinion in the text.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The statement regarding the net loss and foreign currency translation adjustment does not match the provided document.\n- There is no information about internal controls or the auditor's opinion.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

This implies improved inventory levels (decrease in inventory).\n\n3. **Goodwill impairment**: In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, goodwill decreased significantly from $1,983.1 million in 2023 to $913.8 million in 2024, indicating a goodwill impairment charge of $1,069.3 million.

However, the financial document provided does not directly include a statement of cash flows or data on the net cash provided by operating activities.\n\nLet's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - Look for any section in the document that provides cash flow information. Since it's missing, we will focus on financial data that might imply changes in operating activities.\n\n2. **Analyze the Document**:\n   - The closest relevant data we have is the \"Consolidated net earnings\" and related income and expense items from the income statement. Specifically:\n     - Consolidated net earnings for Q1 2024: $630,807\n     - Consolidated net earnings for Q1 2023: $498,629\n\n3. **Calculate the Change in Net Income**:\n   - Change in net income = Net income Q1 2024 - Net income Q1 2023\n   - Change in net income = $630,807 - $498,629 = $132,178\n\n4. **Determine the Percentage Change**:\n   - Percentage change = (Change in net income / Net income Q1 2023) * 100\n   - Percentage change = ($132,178 / $498,629) * 100 \u2248 26.51%\n\n5. **Compare with the Statement**:\n   - The statement claims a -2.83% decrease in net cash provided by operating activities.

            " To verify the statement, we need to analyze the financial document and identify any information related to depreciation and amortization expenses for the year 2023. Here\u2019s how we can approach it:\n\n1. **Identify relevant paragraphs**: We need to check paragraphs that discuss operating activities, financial statements, and any mentions of depreciation and amortization.\n\n2. **Locate financial details**: Specifically, look for details that mention depreciation and amortization expenses for 2023.\n\n3. **Extract numerical values**: Pull out the exact numbers mentioned for depreciation and amortization for the year 2023 and compare them to the statement.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Paragraph 108**: This paragraph mentions an increase in depreciation and amortization of $9,106. However, it does not specify the total depreciation and amortization expenses for 2023.\n\n- **Consolidated Balance Sheets (Paragraph 155)**: These tables include asset values but do not provide direct information on depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\n- **Other paragraphs**: Paragraphs such as 107, 155, and other sections do not directly provide the total depreciation and amortization expenses for 2023.\n\nGiven the available financial document, no explicit total for depreciation and amortization expenses for 2023 is provided. Thus, without this specific data, we cannot directly compare to the statement's figure of $115,050.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince the financial document does not provide the total depreciation and amortization expenses for 2023, we lack the necessary data to confirm or refute the statement. The provided statement about depreciation and amortization expenses in 2023 being $115,050 cannot be verified with the given information.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** based on the lack of supporting data in the document."

Compare this percentage to the given statement.\n\nAnalysis:\n\n1. **Total Revenues for Fiscal Year 2024**:\n\n   According to [paragraph id = 204] and [paragraph id = 385], the total revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, are $2,363,673.\n\n2. **Total Revenues from Commercial Solutions for Fiscal Year 2024**:\n\n   According to [paragraph id = 385], the total revenues from Commercial Solutions for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, are divided into two categories:\n   - Subscription services: $995,803\n   - Professional services: $185,981\n\n   Therefore, the total revenues from Commercial Solutions are:\n   \\[\n   995,803 + 185,981 = 1,181,784\n   \\]\n\n3. **Percentage of Total Revenues from Commercial Solutions**:\n\n   To find the percentage, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\left( \\frac{Total \\ Revenues \\ from \\ Commercial \\ Solutions}{Total \\ Revenues} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\left( \\frac{1,181,784}{2,363,673} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 50.00\\%\n   \\]\n\n4. **Comparison with the Given Statement**:\n\n   The given statement claims that the total revenues from Commercial Solutions account for approximately 49.88% of the company's total revenues. However, our calculation shows that the actual percentage is approximately 50.00%.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe calculated percentage (50.00%) is slightly different from the claimed percentage (49.88%). However, given the rounding and approximation nature, it can be considered reasonably close.\n\nTherefore, the statement is entailed."

Instead, we need to calculate it using the given data.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Calculate the Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA)** for 2022 and 2023.\n\n   The formula for EBITDA is typically:\n   \\[\n   \\text{EBITDA} = \\text{Operating Income} + \\text{Depreciation} + \\text{Amortization} + \\text{Non-cash expenses}\n   \\]\n\n   Since we don't have direct values for Depreciation and Amortization, we'll work with what we have.\n\n2. **Adjusted EBITDA**: Typically, adjustments are made for items like non-cash or non-operating items that can be included in the Operating Income.\n\n   Let's calculate the Operating Income first from the given income statements:\n\n   For the Year Ended December 31, 2023:\n   - Operating Income = $52,061\n   - Add back any non-cash or non-operating expenses listed:\n     - Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets = $17,495\n     - Corporate office costs = $51,953\n\n   Adding these gives us the basis for Adjusted EBITDA:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Adjusted EBITDA}_{2023} = \\text{Operating Income}_{2023} + \\text{Impairment of goodwill} + \\text{Corporate office costs}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Adjusted EBITDA}_{2023} = 52,061 + 17,495 + 51,953 = 121,509\n   \\]\n\n   For the Year Ended December 31, 2022:\n   - Operating Income = $56,801\n   - Add back any non-cash or non-operating expenses listed:\n     - Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets = $9,112\n     - Corporate office costs = $46,111\n\n   Adding these gives us the basis for Adjusted EBITDA:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Adjusted EBITDA}_{2022} = \\text{Operating Income}_{2022} + \\text{Impairment of goodwill} + \\text{Corporate office costs}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Adjusted EBITDA}_{2022} = 56,801 + 9,112 + 46,111 = 112,024\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Percentage Increase**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\frac{\\text{Adjusted EBITDA}_{2023} - \\text{Adjusted EBITDA}_{2022}}{\\text{Adjusted EBITDA}_{2022}} \\times 100\\%\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\frac{121,509 - 112,024}{112,024} \\times 100\\%\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\frac{9,485}{112,024} \\times 100\\% \\approx 8.47\\%\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe calculated percentage increase in Adjusted EBITDA from 2022 to 2023 is approximately 8.47%, which does not match the 5.57% stated in the initial assertion.\n\nTherefore, the statement is: **refuted**."

From paragraph id = 100:\n   - Accounts Payable: $ \u2014 (no impact)\n   - Accrued Expenses: $700,664\n   - Accrued Franchise Tax: $80,000\n   - Accrued Excise Tax: $1,741,420\n   - Income taxes payable: $1,177,040\n   - Advances from Related Parties: $100,770\n   - Note Payable\u2014Sponsor: $4,853,225\n   - Note Payable\u2014Related Party: $600,000\n   - Working Capital Loan\u2014Related Party: $17,935\n   - Deferred Income Taxes: $ \u2014 (no impact)\n   - Warrant Liabilities: $2,090,000\n   - Deferred Underwriting Fee Payable: $8,050,000\n\n   Total potential liabilities = $19,311,054\n\n3. **Attorney Fees**: The document doesn't provide a specific value for attorney fees, but it mentions \"liabilities for accountants, attorneys, consultants, and others.\" We'll consider this as part of the total liabilities calculated above.\n\n4. **Calculating the Redemption Amount per Share**: To find the lowest possible redemption amount per share, we need to subtract the total potential liabilities from the total assets in the trust account and then divide by the number of shares subject to possible redemption.\n\n   Total assets in the trust account = $72,731,536\n   Total liabilities = $19,311,054\n   Shares subject to possible redemption = 6,489,246\n\n   Redemption amount per share = (Total assets - Total liabilities) / Shares\n   = ($72,731,536 - $19,311,054) / 6,489,246\n   = $53,420,482 / 6,489,246\n   \u2248 $8.23 per share\n\nConclusion: The calculated redemption amount per share of approximately $8.23 is less than $9.29 mentioned in the statement.

In this case, we can use the \"Income tax expense\" data provided for both fiscal years and the \"Percent of Sales\" to back-calculate the operating income.\n\nHere's the relevant data for the calculation:\n\n| Fiscal Year | Total Sales (in $'000) | Percent of Sales | Income Tax Expense (in $) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2022 | 4,805,822 | 21.7% | 70,317 |\n| 2023 | 5,090,830 | 22.3% | 33,691 |\n\nFirst, let's calculate the operating income for both fiscal years:\n\nOperating Income = Total Sales * (Percent of Sales / 100)\n\nFor Fiscal 2022:\nOperating Income (2022) = $4,805,822 * (21.7 / 100) = $1,041,348\n\nFor Fiscal 2023:\nOperating Income (2023) = $5,090,830 * (22.3 / 100) = $1,136,166\n\nNext, we'll calculate the net income for both fiscal years:\n\nNet Income = Operating Income - Income Tax Expense\n\nFor Fiscal 2022:\nNet Income (2022) = $1,041,348 - $70,317 = $971,031\n\nFor Fiscal 2023:\nNet Income (2023) = $1,136,166 - $33,691 = $1,102,475\n\nNow, let's calculate the change in net income from Fiscal 2022 to Fiscal 2023:\n\nChange in Net Income = Net Income (2023) - Net Income (2022)\nChange in Net Income = $1,102,475 - $971,031 = $131,444\n\nThe statement claims that the change in net income is precisely $104,978,000, which is not accurate based on our calculation. Additionally, the statement mentions a 46.0% decrease, but our calculation shows an increase in net income.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

We will use the data provided in the financial document to perform this calculation.\n\n1. Identify the segment earnings for Seating for the two periods:\n   - For the period ended April 1, 2023, the segment earnings for Seating are $285.8 million.\n   - For the period ended March 30, 2024, to find the segment earnings for Seating, we need to calculate it using the given data. We can use the Net income attributable to Lear and other expenses to back-calculate the segment earnings for Seating for March 30, 2024.\n\n2. Calculate the segment earnings for Seating for the period ended March 30, 2024:\n   - Net income attributable to Lear for March 30, 2024, is $109.6 million.\n   - To find the segment earnings, we need to add back the expenses and other items that were subtracted to arrive at the net income. These include Selling, general and administrative expenses, Amortization of intangible assets, Interest expense, net, Other expense, net, Provision for income taxes, Equity in net income of affiliates, and Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.\n\n     Segment earnings for Seating (March 30, 2024) = Net income attributable to Lear + Selling, general and administrative expenses + Amortization of intangible assets + Interest expense, net + Other expense, net + Provision for income taxes - Equity in net income of affiliates + Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n\n     Segment earnings for Seating (March 30, 2024) = $109.6 million + $186.5 million + $15.1 million + $26.1 million + $13.5 million + $40.5 million + $10.5 million + $17.3 million\n\n     Segment earnings for Seating (March 30, 2024) = $319.1 million\n\n3. Calculate the percentage decrease in segment earnings for Seating:\n   - Decrease in segment earnings = Segment earnings (April 1, 2023) - Segment earnings (March 30, 2024)\n   - Decrease in segment earnings = $285.8 million - $319.1 million = -$33.3 million\n\n   - Percentage decrease = (Decrease in segment earnings / Segment earnings (April 1, 2023)) * 100\n   - Percentage decrease = (-$33.3 million / $285.8 million) * 100 \u2248 -11.65%\n\nThe calculated percentage decrease in segment earnings for Seating is approximately -11.65%, which does not match the stated decrease of 15.47%.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

            " To verify the statement, we need to analyze the financial data provided regarding the net income contribution from newly developed and expanded facilities, as well as the net operating income from acquired facilities.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Net Income Contribution from Newly Developed and Expanded Facilities:**\n   - The document does not explicitly provide specific net income or net operating income data for newly developed and expanded facilities. We need to check the balance sheet and related notes to see if there is any related information.\n\n2. **Net Operating Income from Acquired Facilities:**\n   - Referencing the financial document, particularly the section titled \"ACQUIRED FACILITIES\" under the \"Three Months Ended March 31,\" we find the following data for three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023:\n     - **2024 Net Operating Income (from 2022 Acquisitions):** $8,063,000\n     - **2023 Net Operating Income (from 2022 Acquisitions):** $6,019,000\n     - **Change in Net Operating Income (from 2022 Acquisitions):** $2,044,000 (Increase)\n     - **2024 Net Operating Income (from 2023 Acquisitions):** $29,108,000\n     - **2023 Net Operating Income (from 2023 Acquisitions):** $209,000\n     - **Change in Net Operating Income (from 2023 Acquisitions):** $28,899,000 (Increase)\n     - **Total Net Operating Income (2024):** $37,171,000\n     - **Total Net Operating Income (2023):** $6,228,000\n     - **Total Change in Net Operating Income:** $30,943,000 (Increase)\n\n3. **Checking the Provided Statement:**\n   - The statement mentions an increase of $1,553,000 in the net income contribution from newly developed and expanded facilities. However, no specific income from such facilities is detailed in the provided document, making it impossible to verify this part of the statement.\n   - The statement also mentions an increase of $30,943,000 in the net operating income from acquired facilities. This aligns with the data detailed in the document, which shows a total change of $30,943,000 in net operating income.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince the document does not provide information about the net income contribution from newly developed and expanded facilities, it is impossible to support or refute the claim of a $1,553,000 increase from these facilities. However, the statement correctly reports the increase in net operating income from acquired facilities.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted regarding the net income from newly developed and expanded facilities due to insufficient data but entailed regarding the net operating income from acquired facilities.\n\nThus, the statement is refuted."

Additionally, White Lion was issued 750,000 shares for $500,000 and another 250,000 shares for commitments under the Common Stock Purchase Agreement.\n\n3. **Calculating the Effective Dividend Yield**:\n   - The dividend rate is 8%.\n   - The investment value per share for the largest investment made in July 2023 is $1.00 (as per the original issue price).\n   - Therefore, the dividend per share is \\( 1.00 \\times 0.08 = $0.08 \\) per share.\n\n4. **Annual Dividend per Investment**:\n   - For the investment of $9,250,000, which bought 9,250,000 shares, the annual dividend would be \\( 9,250,000 \\times 0.08 = $740,000 \\).\n\n5. **Effective Dividend Yield Calculation**:\n   - To find the effective dividend yield, we use the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Effective Dividend Yield} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Annual Dividend}}{\\text{Investment Value}} \\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Effective Dividend Yield} = \\left( \\frac{740,000}{9,250,000} \\right) \\times 100 = 8\\%\n     \\]\n\nThus, the effective dividend yield for the Estrella Series A Preferred Stock, assuming it was held throughout 2023, is indeed 8% of the investment value made in July 2023, based on the 8% declared dividend rate.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

EBITDA stands for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. The EBITDA margin is calculated as EBITDA divided by total revenue.

It does not explicitly provide the EBITDA or revenue figures.\n\n2. **Review Relevant Sections**:\n   - Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 3 provide detailed information about the company's equity changes over various periods, including net income and losses.\n   - Paragraph 6 gives percentage contributions from different customers, which can be indicative of revenue sources but not direct revenue figures.\n   - Paragraphs 9 and 10 provide details on assets, including inventory, other assets, property and equipment, goodwill, and intangible assets. These are essential for understanding the company's financial position but do not directly help in calculating EBITDA.\n\n3. **Analyze Financial Changes**:\n   - From Paragraph 2, we see net income of $8,914 for the period ending December 31, 2023.\n   - The document lacks specific details on interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, which are needed to calculate EBITDA.\n\n4. **Calculate EBITDA Margin**:\n   Without the exact figures for revenue and expenses (interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), we cannot compute the EBITDA. The document does not provide enough data to determine the six-month adjusted EBITDA margin directly.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   The provided financial document does not contain sufficient information to calculate the six-month adjusted EBITDA margin for the period ending December 31, 2023.

The closest relevant data provided is in the \"Impairment and other\" line:\n\n     | ($ in millions, except per share amounts) | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |\n     | ----------------------------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n     | Impairment and other                      | 80   | 112  | 172  |\n\n   - There is no mention of a $478 million impairment charge on a minority investment.\n\n3. **Repurchase Capability:**\n   - The statement mentions a \"$1.1 billion repurchase capability.\"\n   - There is no explicit data in the provided document to support this claim. The document primarily provides financial statements without specific details on repurchase capability.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe statement claims that Foot Locker faced operating cash flow challenges in 2023 due to a net interest expense and a significant impairment charge, indicating a need for careful liquidity monitoring despite a substantial repurchase capability. However:\n- The net interest expense of $9 million is correct.\n- There is no evidence of a $478 million impairment charge on a minority investment in the document.\n- There's no mention of a $1.1 billion repurchase capability in the provided data.\n\nGiven these points, the statement is not entirely supported by the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

            " To determine whether the statement is entailed or refuted by the provided financial document, let's carefully analyze the relevant sections of the document.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Statements on Competition\n**Paragraph ID 184** discusses the competitive landscape of the dog products and services retail industry:\n\n- \"The dog products and services retail industry, in particular on the Internet, is highly competitive and we expect this competition to continue to increase.\"\n- Competitors include pet product retail stores, supermarkets, warehouse clubs, specialty dog supply stores, independent dog stores, catalog retailers, and specialty e-tailers.\n- The competition is based on various factors such as brand recognition, product packaging, quality, innovation, taste, nutrition, breadth of product line, price, and convenience.\n- Many competitors have a longer operating history, greater brand recognition, larger fulfillment infrastructures, greater technical capabilities, significantly greater financial, marketing, and other resources, and larger customer bases.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Need for Economies of Scale\nWhile the document does not explicitly use the term \"economies of scale,\" several points in **paragraph ID 184** suggest the necessity for scale:\n\n- Competitors with \"larger fulfillment infrastructures\" and \"greater financial, marketing, and other resources\" are mentioned.\n- The ability to \"derive greater net sales and profits from their existing customer base\" and \"respond more quickly\" to new technologies and consumer preferences implies the need for scale.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Larger Competitors' Advantages\nThe document highlights that larger competitors can:\n\n- Engage in more extensive research and development efforts.\n- Undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns.\n- Adopt more aggressive pricing policies.\n- Build larger customer bases or generate gross profit from their customer bases more effectively.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe provided document supports the idea that BARK faces significant competitive challenges:\n\n- High competitive rivalry is explicitly mentioned.\n- The document implies the need for economies of scale to lower per-unit costs since competitors with larger resources can leverage these resources more efficiently.\n- Larger competitors have greater financial resources and established market presence, allowing them to engage in activities that smaller companies might find challenging.\n\nTherefore, the statement is supported by the information in the document.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

The company has implemented cybersecurity measures but still acknowledges vulnerabilities and past cyberattacks.\n2. The company relies heavily on third-party vendors for IT infrastructure, which introduces additional risks.\n3. These vulnerabilities could lead to cyber incidents such as data breaches, system outages, and potential intellectual property theft.\n4. The potential consequences of such incidents include harm to reputation, breach of contracts, regulatory actions, and financial losses.\n5. The effectiveness of insurance coverage is mentioned as a potential issue, stating that it may not be sufficient to cover all losses incurred due to a cyber incident.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the analysis**\n\nThe statement aligns with the information provided in the document. The company acknowledges ongoing vulnerabilities despite cybersecurity measures, high reliance on third-party vendors, and the potential for significant impacts from cyber incidents, including questions about the effectiveness of their insurance coverage.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

However, the provided document does not include specific information about the stock price or market valuation.\n\n2. **Net Interest Margin:**\n   - The document provides data on net interest margin:\n     - For the six months ended December 31, 2023, the net interest margin is listed as 2.03%.\n     - For the same period in 2022, the net interest margin is listed as 2.57%.\n\n3. **Federal Interest Rates:**\n   - There is no direct mention of federal interest rates in the document. The statement suggests that effective interest rate risk management was employed amid rising federal interest rates, but this context is not explicitly confirmed in the document.\n\nGiven the information provided in the document:\n\n- The net interest margin for the six months ended December 31, 2023, is 2.03%, not 2.28% as mentioned in the statement.\n- There is no data on the closing market price of $28.20.\n- The context of federal interest rates is not explicitly discussed.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe document states that the net interest margin for the six months ended December 31, 2023, is 2.03%, which contradicts the statement's mention of a 2.28% decrease. Moreover, there is no information provided about the stock valuation or closing market price.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

Any long-term debt obligations and the impact of currency translation on cash.\n3. Any increase in cash flow from operating activities.\n4. Any notable revenue growth.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### 1. Change in Working Capital Deficit\n\nWorking capital is typically defined as current assets minus current liabilities. Let's calculate the working capital for June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2023.\n\n- **June 30, 2023:**\n  - Current Assets: $106,002\n  - Current Liabilities: $219,899\n  - Working Capital: $106,002 - $219,899 = -$113,897\n\n- **December 31, 2023:**\n  - Current Assets: $109,197\n  - Current Liabilities: $348,158\n  - Working Capital: $109,197 - $348,158 = -$238,961\n\nThe working capital deficit increased from June to December 2023.\n\n#### 2. Long-Term Debt Obligations and Impact of Currency Translation\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n\n- **Long-term Liabilities:**\n  - June 30, 2023: $127,029\n  - December 31, 2023: $0\n\nThere is no longer a long-term debt obligation by December 31, 2023. However, the current portion of notes payable increased significantly from June to December 2023.\n\n- **Currency Translation Adjustments:**\n  - For the three months ended December 31, 2022: $51,019\n  - For the six months ended December 31, 2022: $13,943\n  - For the three months ended December 31, 2023: $32,721\n  - For the six months ended December 31, 2023: $9,390\n\nCurrency translation adjustments have had an impact on cash.\n\n#### 3. Increase in Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n\nTo determine the cash flow from operating activities, we typically look at the cash flow statement, which is not provided directly. However, we can infer some information from the income statement.\n\n- **Net Income:**\n  - For the three months ended December 31, 2023: $3,434\n  - For the six months ended December 31, 2023: $328\n\nWhile we cannot directly calculate the cash flow from operating activities, the net income has been positive for the three months ended but negative for the six months ended.\n\n#### 4. Notable Revenue Growth\n\n- **Revenue:**\n  - For the three months ended December 31, 2022: $9,382\n  - For the three months ended December 31, 2023: $10,501\n  - For the six months ended December 31, 2022: $18,358\n  - For the six months ended December 31, 2023: $21,134\n\nThere has been notable revenue growth from December 2022 to December 2023.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe working capital deficit increased significantly from June to December 2023. Long-term debt obligations were converted to short-term, and currency translation adjustments impacted cash. Net income was positive for the last three months but negative for the six-month period, indicating potential cash flow issues. Revenue growth was notable.\n\nThus, the statement is supported by the financial data provided.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

This indicates a decline in financial performance.\n\n2. **Substantial Increase in Depreciation Expenses:**\n   - The statement claims a significant increase in depreciation expenses due to residual value deterioration.\n   - In the financial document, the depreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges, net, increased from $381 million in 2023 to $969 million in 2024. This is a substantial increase that supports the claim of high depreciation expenses in early 2024.\n\n3. **Rising Interest Expenses:**\n   - The statement mentions rising interest expenses.\n   - Interest expense, net, increased from $162 million in 2023 to $216 million in 2024. This increase in interest expenses supports the claim.\n\n4. **Negative Adjusted EBITDA:**\n   - The statement claims that these factors led to a negative Adjusted Corporate EBITDA of $567 million.\n   - According to the Consolidated Results of Operations \u2013 Hertz, the Adjusted Corporate EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was indeed $(567) million, compared to $237 million in 2023.\n\nBased on the provided financial document and the details analyzed, the statement accurately reflects the financial performance of Hertz Global in early 2024 with a significant increase in depreciation and interest expenses leading to a negative Adjusted EBITDA of $567 million.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

The relationship between net income and operational cash flow is often influenced by non-operational decisions, such as dividend policy and impairment losses, which could restrict cash flow despite improved net income.

This schedule supports the statement about ensuring long-term commitment.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The financial document provides clear evidence that the compensation strategy includes time-vested equity awards.\n   - The vesting schedule of four years aligns with the statement's assertion about addressing long-term retention goals.\n   - The compensation philosophy discussed explicitly supports the idea of aligning executive interests with stockholder returns.\n\nTherefore, the statement is entailed."

George Risk Industries, Inc. possesses assets valued at $33.6 million as of January 31, 2024.\n2. The company faced internal control weaknesses.\n3. The company experienced unrealized losses driven by interest rate increases on municipal bonds held as Level 2 inputs.\n\nLet's analyze each claim step by step:\n\n**1. Asset Value:**\nThe financial documents provided do not include a balance sheet which would list the total assets of the company. Therefore, we cannot verify the asset value of $33.6 million directly from the given information.\n\n**2. Internal Control Weaknesses:**\nThe financial documents provided (Income Statements, Statement of Comprehensive Income, and Statements of Stockholders\u2019 Equity) do not explicitly mention internal control weaknesses. This information is usually found in the accompanying notes or in a separate report on internal controls. Since it is not mentioned in the provided documents, we cannot confirm this claim based on the given information.\n\n**3. Unrealized Losses due to Interest Rate Increases on Municipal Bonds:**\nThe Condensed Statement of Comprehensive Income shows unrealized gains, not losses, on debt securities for both the three and nine months periods ended January 31, 2024. Here are the relevant figures:\n\n- For the three months ended January 31, 2024, Unrealized holding gains arising during the period were $418,000.\n- For the nine months ended January 31, 2024, Unrealized holding gains arising during the period were $98,000.\n\nThese figures indicate unrealized gains, not losses, contradicting the statement's claim of unrealized losses.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the provided financial documents, we cannot confirm the asset value or internal control weaknesses. More importantly, the documents show unrealized gains on debt securities, contradicting the claim of unrealized losses due to interest rate increases on municipal bonds.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

However, the mentioned cyclicality and dependency on TiO2 pricing suggest potential challenges in maintaining stable cash flows.\n\nGiven the provided document, while it confirms the cyclical nature of TiO2 demand and pricing, and the impact on Kronos' profitability, it does not directly support or refute the claim that Kronos faces challenges in cash flow management, debt refinancing, or meeting debt obligations.

Specifically, it references a problem with the deferred tax liability and the Section 585 reserve method.\n   - The document states that the material weakness \"resulted in the correction of the material errors and restatement of prior financial statements as disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated audited financial statements contained in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 20, 2023.\"\n\n2. **Review the Specifics of the Material Weakness**:\n   - The weakness involved the application of the Section 585 reserve method, which was erroneously used. The company maintained a deferred tax liability that it would not be required to recapture.\n   - This indicates that there was a material oversight in the company's financial reporting controls.\n\n3. **Timeframe of the Material Weakness**:\n   - The document mentions the restatement of prior financial statements but does not explicitly state that the material weakness persisted from 2021 to 2024.\n   - However, it does state that the material weakness was significant enough to require correction and restatement of prior financial statements as of September 20, 2023.\n\n4. **Assess the Statement**:\n   - The statement claims the material weakness persisted from 2021 to 2024. The document confirms there was a material weakness involving the Section 585 reserve method that affected financial reporting and required corrections.\n   - However, the document does not specify the exact duration of the weakness as persisting from 2021 to 2024.

Here\u2019s the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data Points**:\n   - We need to find information regarding foreign currency translation adjustments and their impact on comprehensive income.\n   - The relevant data is likely to be in the \"Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\" section under \"Other comprehensive income, net of tax\".\n\n2. **Analyze the Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments**:\n   - In the \"Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\" for the nine months ended December 31, 2023:\n     ```\n     Foreign currency translation adjustments: $8,665\n     ```\n   - This indicates that the foreign currency translation adjustments contributed positively to the \"Other comprehensive income, net of tax\".\n\n3. **Assess the Impact on Comprehensive Income**:\n   - The comprehensive income for the nine months ended December 31, 2023, is calculated as:\n     ```\n     Comprehensive income attributable to Houlihan Lokey, Inc.: $207,889\n     ```\n   - The net income before the foreign currency translation adjustments is:\n     ```\n     Net income: $199,224\n     ```\n   - Adding the foreign currency translation adjustments to the net income gives:\n     ```\n     Comprehensive income = Net income + Foreign currency translation adjustments\n                          = $199,224 + $8,665\n                          = $207,889\n     ```\n\n4. **Evaluate the Statement**:\n   - The statement claims that the net impact of foreign currency fluctuations indicates effective use of foreign currency forward contracts.\n   - The positive foreign currency translation adjustments suggest that Houlihan Lokey effectively managed foreign currency risks, potentially through the use of forward contracts or other hedging strategies, as the fluctuations resulted in a gain rather than a loss.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the positive impact of foreign currency translation adjustments on comprehensive income, it supports the statement that Houlihan Lokey effectively used foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against risks.\n\nTherefore, the statement is entailed."

It implies that the CEO's rewards are closely integrated with the company's operational financing maneuvers.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Information in the Document**: We need to look for information related to the CEO's compensation package, RSUs, and any mention of the credit line or operational financing.\n\n   - **CEO's Compensation and RSUs**: Paragraph 364 discusses the CEO's compensation package, including RSUs. It mentions that the CEO was awarded up to an aggregate of 5,500,000 RSUs, with 500,000 RSUs vested on March 31, 2024, 3,000,000 RSUs vesting ratably over a period of twenty-four 24 months beginning April 2, 2024, and the remaining 2,000,000 RSUs, along with cash bonuses, vesting upon the achievement of certain milestones.\n\n   - **Credit Line (JVR credit line)**: Paragraph 364 also mentions that the Company drew an additional $10,000 on the related party line of credit note on March 25, 2024.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Information**:\n   - The vesting schedule of the CEO's RSUs is spread out over time, with a significant portion vesting over 24 months and the rest upon achieving certain milestones. This suggests a focus on long-term goals and performance rather than short-term operational goals.\n   - There is no direct link or indication in the document that the vesting schedule is tied to drawdowns on the credit line or short-term operational financing maneuvers.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the given document, the statement that the allocation and vesting schedule of RSUs in the CEO's compensation package could incentivize short-term operational goals aligned with drawdowns on the JVR credit line is not supported. The document does not establish a direct connection between the RSU vesting schedule and short-term operational financing maneuvers.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

There were over 16.3 million share-based equity awards excluded from the dilutive EPS (earnings per share) calculation due to strong anti-dilutive effects.\n2. The valuation of private placement and PIPE warrants applied the Black-Scholes model in 2023, reflecting a comprehensive internal assessment.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the Document\nLet's check what the document says about the points in the statement.\n\n#### Point 1: Share-based Equity Awards\nThe document does not mention anything about \"16.3 million share-based equity awards\" or their exclusion from the dilutive EPS calculation. The document provides details on financial instruments and their fair value measurements, but it does not discuss EPS calculation or specific numbers of share-based equity awards.\n\n#### Point 2: Valuation of Private Placement and PIPE Warrants\nIn paragraph [397], the document states:\n- In 2023, the valuation of private placement warrants, PIPE warrants, and Abaca warrants was carried out using the Black-Scholes model. This aligns with the statement claiming that the Black-Scholes model was used in 2023.\n- Management mentions a change in the valuation method for PIPE warrants to a more precise and tailored approach, supporting the idea of a comprehensive internal assessment.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Facts\n- The document supports the statement that private placement and PIPE warrants were valued using the Black-Scholes model in 2023.\n- The document does not provide any information about 16.3 million share-based equity awards or their impact on dilutive EPS.\n\n### Final Step: Conclusion\nGiven the information in the document:\n- The use of the Black-Scholes model for the valuation of private placement and PIPE warrants is confirmed.\n- The exclusion of 16.3 million share-based equity awards from the dilutive EPS calculation is not mentioned or supported in the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

However, the reduction in deferred tax assets from $691 thousand in 2022 to $0 in 2023 may imply a valuation allowance was established, completely offsetting the deferred tax assets.\n\n3. **Three-year cumulative loss position**: In the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, we find the following net losses:\n   - 2023: $(4,154) thousand\n   - 2022: $(1,084) thousand\n   Although the document doesn't provide information about 2021, the statement mentions a \"three-year cumulative loss position,\" implying that 2021 also incurred a loss.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statement:\n\n- The statement mentions that Psychemedics Corporation maintains a full valuation allowance of $2.6 million against its deferred tax assets in 2023. However, the financial document only shows deferred tax assets of $0 for that year. This discrepancy refutes the statement.\n\n- The statement also attributes this decision to segment reporting constraints and a three-year cumulative loss position.

This challenge is attributed to the increased interest burden, especially given the rising SOFR rates.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Financial Document:**\n   - **Debt Increase:** The document mentions that the Term Loan was refinanced to $1,500.0 million on September 20, 2023 (paragraph id = 105).\n   - **Interest Rate:** The Term Loan bears interest at an annual rate equal to SOFR plus 2.5%, with a 0.75% SOFR floor (paragraph id = 105).\n   - **Cash Reserves:** The \"Cash and cash equivalents\" increased from $71,870 (thousand) at December 31, 2023, to $174,025 (thousand) at March 31, 2024 (paragraph id = 0).\n\n3. **Reasoning:**\n   - The company indeed increased its Term Loan, leading to a significant rise in cash reserves.\n   - The interest rate on the Term Loan is tied to SOFR, which could potentially increase the interest burden if SOFR rates rise.\n   - However, the document does not provide specific information about the company's current or projected debt servicing ratio, nor does it discuss the company's ability to maintain a favorable ratio in the future.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   While the document confirms the increase in Term Loan and cash reserves, it does not provide sufficient information to support or refute the claim about future challenges in maintaining a favorable debt servicing ratio.

The most relevant sections for assessing liquidity and deferred payments are the equity section and the tables on carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments.\n\n2. **Examine the Equity Section**:\n   - The equity section shows various transactions related to the issuance of shares, including the \"Issuance of shares in connection with Business Combination and PIPE offering\" and \"Acquisition of Abaca.\" It also details net losses and net income (loss).\n   - However, there is no explicit mention of \"reverse recapitalization\" or specific \"deferred payments\" in the equity section.\n\n3. **Examine Carrying Amounts and Fair Values of Financial Instruments**:\n   - The document provides tables for assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022.\n   - In the \"Liabilities\" section, under \"Deferred consideration,\" there is an amount of $2,889,792 for 2023 and $14,359,822 for 2022.\n   - There are also entries for \"Due to seller - current portion\" and \"Due to seller - long term portion\" in 2022, totaling $56,949,800 ($25,973,017 + $30,976,783).\n\n4. **Analyze the Statement**:\n   - The statement mentions \"reverse recapitalization\" allowing SHF Holdings Inc. to manage liquidity challenges by structuring deferred payments totaling $56,949,800.\n   - The only section that shows amounts close to $56,949,800 is the \"Due to seller\" entries in the 2022 liabilities table.\n   - However, there is no direct mention of \"reverse recapitalization\" in the document.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The document does not explicitly support the claim that a \"reverse recapitalization\" occurred or that deferred payments totaling $56,949,800 were structured to ease liquidity challenges.\n   - The absence of a clear correlation between the statement and the provided data suggests the statement is not directly supported.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

We need to locate these items in the financial document.\n\n   - Interest expense can be found in the \"CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\" table.\n   - Interest rate swaps are mentioned in the fair value table under \"Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)\".\n\n2. **Analyze Interest Expense**:\n   - For the three months ended November 25, 2023, interest expense was $1,454 thousand.\n   - For the three months ended November 26, 2022, interest expense was $2,590 thousand.\n\n3. **Calculate the Percentage Change in Interest Expense**:\n   - The decrease in interest expense is $2,590 - $1,454 = $1,136 thousand.\n   - The percentage decrease is \\(\\frac{1,136}{2,590} \\times 100 \\approx 43.86\\%\\).\n\n4. **Evaluate the Role of Interest Rate Swaps**:\n   - The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is listed under \"Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)\".\n   - As of November 25, 2023, the value is $1,550 thousand.\n   - As of February 25, 2023, the value was $1,817 thousand.\n\n   The document does not directly attribute the reduction in interest expense to the strategic use of interest rate swaps. However, the presence of interest rate swap contracts suggests they may be part of the company's risk management strategy.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The interest expense did indeed decrease by approximately 43.9%.\n   - Although the document mentions interest rate swaps, it does not explicitly state that this reduction is directly due to their use.\n\nGiven the data, the statement about the reduction in interest expense is accurate, but the causal link to the strategic use of interest rate swaps is not explicitly confirmed in the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

Let's break this down:\n\n- **Strategic flexibility in sourcing licorice raw materials**: The document mentions that the company has \"long-standing relationships with key raw material suppliers\" and \"maintenance of substantial raw material reserve inventory around the world\" (paragraph id = 20). It also highlights that the company purchases licorice raw materials from various countries including China (paragraph id = 77).\n- **Leveraging geographic market penetration opportunities in India and China**: There is no specific mention of the company leveraging these opportunities in India and China. While China is mentioned as a source of licorice raw materials, there's no indication of the company using this to penetrate the market in India or China.\n- **Ensuring supply stability even in varying economic climates**: The document discusses the company's strategies for maintaining supply stability, such as having an exclusive supply contract, maintaining inventory, and having open purchase contracts (paragraph id = 34). However, this is not specifically tied to economic climates.\n\n3. Document each step of your reasoning process to ensure your assessment is clear and thorough.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the document does mention strategies for supply stability and does mention China as a source of licorice raw materials. However, it does not explicitly state that the company is leveraging these sourcing strategies for geographic market penetration in India or China, nor does it tie these strategies to varying economic climates.\n\n4.

Paragraphs 242 and 243 detail the substantial non-cash impairment charges, including $65.6 million for long-lived assets and $282.2 million for goodwill.\n3. The goodwill impairment was primarily due to a sustained decline in market capitalization, which suggests the company\u2019s current market value had decreased significantly compared to its earlier assessments. This necessitated reevaluating asset book values.\n4. Market Efficiency Theory posits that current market prices reflect all available information, which influences the valuation of company assets. Hence, the need to adjust goodwill and asset valuations aligns with the market's revised valuation of the company.\n5. Despite attempts to control and reduce expenses through the Plan, external factors such as market valuation pressure led to significant impairments, demonstrating how external assessments can necessitate internal financial adjustments.",

The statement refers to Star Alliance International Corp.'s compliance with fair value measurement standards, Level 3 derivative liability, complex valuation assumptions, and the company's going concern status.\n\n1. **Fair Value Measurement Standards and Level 3 Derivative Liability**:\n   The statement mentions a significant Level 3 derivative liability. According to financial accounting standards, Level 3 assets and liabilities are those that are valued using significant unobservable inputs (complex assumptions). The document includes a line item labeled \"Derivative liability,\" which has a value of $1,109,784 at December 31, 2023, and $1,010,145 at June 30, 2023. This item substantially contributes to the company's current liabilities.\n\n2. **Valuation Assumptions**:\n   The presence of a large \"Derivative liability\" implies that the company is using complex valuation assumptions to measure its financial position. This attests to the complexity of valuation methods the company might be employing.\n\n3. **Going Concern Status**:\n   The statement implies uncertainty about the company's going concern status. From the \"Statement of Operations,\" we see a \"Net loss\" for the three months and six months ended December 31, 2023, at $594,391 and $966,863, respectively, and for the same periods in 2022, at $2,182,732 and $9,559,411, respectively. Such continuous and substantial net losses could raise concerns about the company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n   Additionally, the \"Stockholders\u2019 Equity (Deficit)\" section shows a deficit of $(1,600,992) at December 31, 2023, and $(1,202,385) at June 30, 2023. This indicates the company has negative equity, further supporting uncertainty about its going concern status.\n\nBy evaluating these points:\n- The company has a significant \"Derivative liability,\" which suggests the use of complex valuation assumptions.\n- The company has sustained substantial net losses and has negative stockholders' equity, indicating potential going concern issues.\n\nTherefore, the statement is supported by the document details as it accurately reflects the presence of complex valuation assumptions and uncertainty about the company's going concern status.\n\nConclusion: Therefore, the statement is **entailed**."

            " To verify the given statement, we need to analyze the provided financial document and focus on the relevant information regarding Alphabet's repurchase of Class C shares and dividend issuance. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Class C Share Repurchases:**\n   From the table under \"Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities,\" we can calculate the total expenditure on Class C share repurchases for Q1 2024 (January to March):\n   - January: 29,623,000 shares * $146.28 = $4,339,914,400\n   - February: 28,804,000 shares * $144.75 = $4,168,808,000\n   - March: 29,230,000 shares * $143.86 = $4,208,273,800\n   Total expenditure = $4,339,914,400 + $4,168,808,000 + $4,208,273,800 = $12,716,996,200 or approximately $12.7 billion\n\n   This confirms the statement's reference to the $12.7 billion Class C share repurchase in Q1 2024.\n\n2. **Dividend Issuance:**\n   The statement mentions a \"steady dividend issuance,\" but the provided financial document does not contain any information about dividends paid during this period. Therefore, we cannot confirm or refute the dividend part of the statement based on the given document.\n\n3. **Capital Allocation Strategy and Shareholder Value:**\n   The statement suggests that the share repurchases represent a strategic capital allocation approach emphasizing growth in shareholder value. Since share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, they can increase earnings per share and potentially boost the stock price, benefiting shareholders.\n\n4. **Capital Structure Adjustment:**\n   The statement also claims that the capital structure is adjusted to favor shareholders of higher agglomerate voting power. Alphabet has a dual-class share structure, with Class A shares having one vote each and Class C shares having no votes. By repurchasing Class C (non-voting) shares, Alphabet increases the relative voting power of Class A shares. This supports the statement's claim about adjusting the capital structure to favor shareholders with voting power.\n\nBased on the provided financial document, the statement's claims about the Class C share repurchases and capital structure adjustment are supported. However, the document does not provide information to confirm the \"steady dividend issuance\" part of the statement.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTherefore, the statement is partially entailed, as the provided document supports most of the claims, but lacks information about dividends. If we focus solely on the share repurchase aspect, the statement is entailed. However, considering the statement as a whole, it is refuted due to the lack of dividend information.\n\nFinal determination: **Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

            " ### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information in the Document:**\n   - **Paragraph [25]** discusses lock-up agreements affecting 7,241,179 PubCo Ordinary Shares. These agreements restrict the sale or transfer of shares for at least 6 months and up to 12 months post-Business Combination.\n\n2. **Analyze the Document Related to Lock-Up Agreements:**\n   - The lock-up agreements relate to shareholders owning more than 15% of the issued and outstanding PubCo Ordinary Shares, with LEW shareholders being the main focus.\n   - Restrictions apply: shareholders are prohibited from selling, pledging, or disposing of these shares for a specified period, though certain exceptions like gift or court order apply.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Statement:**\n   - The statement mentions that the lock-up could create short-term market pressure on PubCo's share value due to limited liquidity.\n   - Limited liquidity refers to the lack of available shares in the market, which could indeed impact market dynamics by potentially driving up prices due to lower supply.\n\n4. **Support the Conclusion with the Document:**\n   - **Paragraph [25] explicitly mentions the lock-up agreements and the impact on 7,241,179 shares for 6-12 months.**\n   - The general theme of risks, specifically regarding market perceptions and potential stock value reduction, is corroborated in **Paragraph [66]** when discussing going public through a business combination.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement aligns with the details provided in the document regarding the lock-up agreements and the potential market impact of limited liquidity. Therefore, the statement can be considered entailed by the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

            " To determine if the statement is entailed or refuted, we need to analyze the provided financial document and focus on the relevant data related to the working capital deficit.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Context\nThe statement mentions a working capital deficit. Working capital is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Relevant Data\nWe need to look at the current assets and current liabilities for June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2023, from the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Working Capital for Both Periods\n\n#### For June 30, 2023:\n- Current Assets: $106,002\n- Current Liabilities: $219,899\n- Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities\n- Working Capital (June 30, 2023) = $106,002 - $219,899 = $(113,897)\n\n#### For December 31, 2023:\n- Current Assets: $109,197\n- Current Liabilities: $348,158\n- Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities\n- Working Capital (December 31, 2023) = $109,197 - $348,158 = $(238,961)\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Working Capital for Both Periods\n- Working Capital Deficit on June 30, 2023: $(113,897)\n- Working Capital Deficit on December 31, 2023: $(238,961)\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Statement\nThe statement claims that the working capital deficit increased from $113,179 to $238,961. However, our calculations show that the working capital deficit was $(113,897) on June 30, 2023, and $(238,961) on December 31, 2023.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe statement is almost correct but has a minor discrepancy in the initial working capital deficit value. The calculated initial deficit is $(113,897), not $113,179. The final deficit matches exactly.\n\nTherefore, the statement is entailed, as the main point about the increase in the working capital deficit is accurately represented, despite the small discrepancy in the initial value.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is entailed.**"

Paragraph 115 supports this increase in the valuation allowance with data points showing the additive effect leading to the end-of-year balance. \n3. The concept of lease accounting, relevant in paragraph 112, indicates that the company's right-of-use liabilities sit at $138 as of December 31, 2023. A high lease liability and a short weighted-average remaining lease term of 0.9 years, alongside a discount rate of 8%, suggest an aggressive leasing strategy that may stress cash flow and affect future taxable income.\n4.

This is a significant year-over-year increase.\n\n2. **Constraints in Utilizing Deferred Tax Assets**:\n   - The statement infers that the increase in valuation allowance indicates constraints in utilizing deferred tax assets.\n   - A high valuation allowance suggests that the company expects it might not be able to realize all of its deferred tax assets, indicating a constraint.\n\n3. **High Operating Lease Liabilities**:\n   - The statement mentions high operating lease liabilities of $138.\n   - Under \"Liabilities,\" the document lists \"Right-of-use liabilities, current\" as $138 for 2023.\n\n4. **Short Weighted-Average Remaining Lease Term**:\n   - The statement refers to a short weighted-average remaining lease term of 0.9 years.\n   - Under \"Weighted-average remaining lease term,\" the document lists 0.9 years for 2023.\n\n5. **Weighted-Average Discount Rate**:\n   - The statement mentions an 8% weighted-average discount rate.\n   - Under \"Weighted-average discount rate,\" the document lists 8% for 2023.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAll key elements of the statement (valuation allowance, operating lease liabilities, remaining lease term, and discount rate) are accurately reflected in the financial document. The significant increase in the valuation allowance and the high operating lease liabilities, along with the short remaining lease term and discount rate, bolster the inference about constraints in utilizing deferred tax assets.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

We need to verify if there are any significant changes in revenue or assets that might indicate such divestitures.\n\n3. **Check for Strategic Realignment**:\n   - The statement about realignment towards payments and data solutions should be reflected in the revenue segments and possibly in the goodwill or intangibles sections.\n\n4. **Free Cash Flow Improvement**:\n   - The financial document does not provide direct information about free cash flow or specific targets for 2026.

Payments increased from $678,580 in 2022 to $690,704 in 2023, and Data Solutions decreased from $267,525 to $238,817. This could suggest a shift in focus but does not provide clear evidence of realignment.\n- **Intangibles**: The intangibles section shows changes in technology-based intangibles and other categories, which might reflect a strategic shift.\n\n#### Free Cash Flow Improvement:\n- There is no direct mention of a $100 million improvement in free cash flow or specific cost reductions and growth initiatives in the document.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe financial document does not provide explicit evidence to support the statement about significant divestitures in web hosting and logo design, strategic realignment through the North Star program, or a specific target for improving free cash flow by $100 million by 2026.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

The gain from the contingent consideration is related to adjustments on expected future payouts, considered a contingent liability, impacting financial results even without cash flow.\n5.

            " To verify the statement, we'll analyze the relevant financial data provided in the document. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Revaluation Gain**: The statement mentions a revaluation gain of $26.9 million on contingent consideration in 2023. We can see this value in the \"Loss from operations\" table under \"Revaluation of contingent consideration\" for the year ended December 31, 2023: `$(26,900)`. The negative sign indicates a gain, as it reduces the loss from operations.\n\n2. **Intangible Asset Impairment**: The statement also mentions a substantial intangible asset impairment. In the same table, we find \"Intangible asset impairment\" for the year ended December 31, 2023: `$6,629`. This positive value indicates an expense, which increases the loss from operations.\n\n3. **Impact on Loss from Operations**: The revaluation gain reduces the loss from operations, while the impairment increases it. To verify if the gain positively impacts the loss from operations despite the impairment, we can check the total \"Loss from operations\" for the year 2023: `$(97,357)`. Although this is still a loss, it is less than the loss from operations in 2022: `$(89,854)`, indicating that the revaluation gain had a net positive impact.\n\n4. **Going Concern Status**: The statement suggests that the positive impact aligns with maintaining the company's going concern status. However, the provided document does not include explicit information about the company's going concern status. Therefore, we can't definitively confirm or refute this part of the statement based on the given data.\n\n**Conclusion**: While the statement's claim about the going concern status can't be verified with the provided data, the remainder of the statement is supported by the document. Therefore, based on the given financial data, the statement is partially entailed. However, since we can't confirm all parts of the statement, we should conclude:\n\n\"Therefore, the statement is refuted.\" (as we cannot confirm the going concern status part of the statement)"

Paragraph 105 outlines Rising Star Company's significant indebtedness, showing total debt of $421.7 million and the long-term capital risks associated with their financial structure.\n2.

It states, \"To the extent inflation rates were to significantly exceed our ability to achieve price increases or cost savings, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\"\n  - The paragraph indicates that the company is aware of inflation risks but doesn't assert that these impacts have been fully mitigated.\n\n#### 2. **Rising Star Company faces reduced interest rate exposure risks due to variable rate debt**\n- The document does not mention specific details about variable rate debt or interest rate exposure risks. No direct references support or refute this part of the statement.\n\n#### 3. **shrinking transaction-related costs, particularly if the ongoing Merger does not close**\n- **Paragraph 122** discusses the potential costs and impacts related to the Merger:\n  - \"significant expenses for professional services in connection with the Merger for which we will have received little or no benefit if the Merger is not consummated\"\n  - This indicates that there are costs associated with the Merger that would not be beneficial if the Merger does not close.\n- Additionally, it states, \"Any significant diversion of management\u2019s attention away from ongoing business and difficulties encountered in the Merger process could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\"\n  - This suggests potential adverse effects on the company's operations and financial condition due to the Merger, but it does not specifically mention shrinking transaction-related costs.\n\n#### 4. **necessitating further strategic financial interventions to maintain stability**\n- The document frequently refers to potential adverse effects on the company's financial condition and the need for strategic actions to mitigate risks. However, these mentions are in the context of general economic conditions, growth strategies, and the Merger, rather than directly discussing further strategic financial interventions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the provided financial document, the statement contains elements that are not directly supported or refuted by the text. The document discusses inflation risks but does not claim they have been fully mitigated. It mentions costs related to the Merger and potential adverse effects but does not provide specifics about variable rate debt or shrinking transaction-related costs. Furthermore, it does not explicitly mention the need for further strategic financial interventions to maintain stability in the context described by the statement.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

This could raise the possibility of being classified as an unregistered investment company.\n   - If deemed an investment company, the company may need to liquidate, impacting investors.\n\n2. **Analyze the Statement**\n   - The statement mentions \"substantial doubt regarding its ability to continue as a going concern.\"\n   - It suggests \"certainty of reclassification under the Investment Company Act if it fails to consummate a de-SPAC transaction by November 14, 2023,\" leading to \"mandatory liquidation\" and affecting investors' realized value from redeemable shares.\n\n3. **Compare with the Financial Document**\n   - The document discusses the uncertainty around the Investment Company Act and the risk of not completing the initial business combination within 24 months, which could lead to liquidation.\n   - However, the document does not explicitly mention a specific date, such as November 14, 2023, for reclassification or mandatory liquidation.\n\n4. **Specific Points**\n   - The document states there is a \"risk\" of not completing the initial business combination within 24 months.\n   - It discusses the possibility of being deemed an investment company, potentially leading to liquidation.\n   - The document does not confirm any certainty of reclassification, mandatory liquidation, or a specific date by which this will occur.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe statement implies certainty about the reclassification and mandatory liquidation by a specific date (November 14, 2023), which is not supported by the provided document. The document only mentions risks and uncertainties without confirming any specific outcomes or dates. Therefore, the statement is not supported by the document.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

Controlled investing activities.\n\nFirst, let's examine the financial document to identify information related to these points.\n\n**1. Significant cash outlay for repayment of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes in 2023:**\nThe document shows a \"Loss on extinguishment of debt\" of $2,279 for the year 2023. This indicates that the company paid off some debt, possibly the 2024 Senior Secured Notes.\n\n**2. Balance of cash and cash equivalents:**\nThe document does not explicitly provide the balance of cash and cash equivalents. However, it does not mention any significant changes in cash balance either.\n\n**3. Reduced payment of issuance costs:**\nThe document does not provide direct information on the payment of issuance costs, but it does mention \"Transaction expenses\" of $4,875 in 2023 compared to $283 in 2022. This suggests that issuance costs were reduced.\n\n**4. Controlled investing activities:**\nThe document does not provide detailed information on investing activities, so it is challenging to assess whether they were controlled.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The company appears to have made a debt repayment, as indicated by the \"Loss on extinguishment of debt.\"\n- There is no specific information on the balance of cash and cash equivalents to confirm stability.\n- Transaction expenses were lower in 2023 compared to 2022, suggesting reduced issuance costs.\n- The document lacks sufficient information on investing activities to conclude whether they were controlled.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the available information, the statement partially aligns with the financial document, particularly concerning the debt repayment and reduced issuance costs. However, the document lacks sufficient information to conclusively demonstrate the stability of the cash balance or controlled investing activities. Therefore, the statement is not fully supported by the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

        "explanation": "1. Paragraph 15 details SCE's potential credit risk exposure, particularly mentioning a $123 million collateral requirement that could arise from adverse market price movements affecting existing power and fuel derivative contracts.\n2. Revenue recognition principles often require the company to have reasonable assurance around regulatory recoverability for revenue recognition. Paragraph 14 outlines the CPUC's proposed decision for SCE to recover $312 million in capital and $200 million in operational and maintenance expenses related to wildfires, which includes $191 million in revenue subject to amortization over 12 months, pending CPUC final approval.\n3. A proper understanding of revenue recognition principles, specifically Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 980-340 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, necessitates that revenue can't be recognized unless the utility has been legally granted the authority to do so.\n4. The potential financial impact from market risks, as detailed in paragraph 21, could influence SCE\u2019s creditworthiness and hence its ability to hedge such exposures without additional collateral. This aligns with guidelines on market risk exposure assessment under review of qualitative disclosures. This linkage highlights the broader financial environment impacting SCE's revenue strategy and operational sustainability.\n5. The statement incorrectly minimizes SCE's credit risk exposure by altering the collateral requirement to $1.23 million instead of the correct $123 million. This significant understatement of potential financial hedging collateral requirements misrepresents the actual risk level SCE faces if market prices move adversely. Such exposure is material, as it can impact SCE's liquidity and credit rating.",

            " To assess the truthfulness of the given statement, we need to analyze the provided financial document and focus on the relevant data related to stock redemptions, Trust Account balance, and the company's dependence on external financing.\n\n1. **Stock Redemptions**:\n   - In paragraph 116, there are two stockholder redemptions mentioned:\n     - Redemption of 7,391,973 shares at a redemption value of $76,054,240.\n     - Redemption of 1,363,378 shares at a redemption value of $14,619,421.\n   - The total redemption amount is $76,054,240 + $14,619,421 = $90,673,661.\n   - The statement mentions significant redemptions totaling $100,000,000, but the actual total redemptions from the document are approximately $90,673,661.\n\n2. **Trust Account Balance**:\n   - In paragraph 104, the \"Investments held in Trust Account\" balance as of December 31, 2023, is $29,718,024.\n   - The statement mentions that the Trust Account maintains $40,000,000, but the actual balance is approximately $29,718,024.\n\n3. **Dependence on External Financing**:\n   - The statement suggests that the company remains dependent on external financing or successful mergers due to limited internal funding for future business combinations.\n   - Given the discrepancies in redemption amounts and the Trust Account balance, we need to examine if the company's cash flows and financial position support this claim.\n   - In paragraph 108, the \"Net Change in Cash\" for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, is $168,476, which is relatively low.\n   - The company had a \"Net cash used in operating activities\" of $(1,986,013) and a \"Net cash provided by financing activities\" of $(88,674,219), indicating significant cash outflows for financing activities, likely related to redemptions.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the statement is not entirely accurate regarding the redemption amounts and the Trust Account balance. However, the company's cash flows indicate significant outflows and a low net change in cash, suggesting a dependence on external financing or successful mergers for future business combinations.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted based on the inaccuracies in the redemption amounts and the Trust Account balance."

Paragraph 272 provides insight into ThredUp's revenue sources, emphasizing that their international exposure includes transactions denominated in various currencies.\n5. The concepts of 'Foreign Currency Translation' and 'Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income' explain how translation adjustments can affect reported equity positions in companies operating internationally. This adjustment partly mitigated the impact of the reported net loss, as currency translation gains contribute to comprehensive income even when direct hedging is absent.\n6.

There is no mention of a specific foreign currency translation adjustment of $0.8 million. The text states they manage risks through natural hedges and matching but do not explicitly mention hedging arrangements for foreign currency risk.\n\n   - **Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss:**\n     - In the Consolidated Balance Sheets (December 31, 2023), the \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\" is listed as $(2,375) for 2023. This does not match the significant increase mentioned in the statement.\n\n   - **Net Loss:**\n     - There is no explicit mention of a net loss of $71.2 million in the document. Gross profit and other income-related details are given, but not the net loss explicitly.\n\n3. **Document each step of the reasoning process:**\n\n   - **Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment:**\n     - The provided document does not specify an unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustment of $0.8 million. It only discusses the general exposure and risk management approach.\n\n   - **Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss:**\n     - The balance sheet shows an accumulated other comprehensive loss of $(2,375), which contradicts a significant increase implied by the statement.\n\n   - **Net Loss:**\n     - No specific net loss figure is provided in the document, so the $71.2 million figure cannot be confirmed.\n\n4. **Conclude the analysis:**\n\nGiven the provided evidence in the financial document:\n\n1. There is no mention of an unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustment of $0.8 million.\n2. The accumulated other comprehensive loss does not reflect a significant increase due to foreign currency adjustments.\n3. The document does not confirm a net loss of $71.2 million for 2023.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

This plan's purpose encourages ownership and long-term commitment, aligning with the concept of balancing executive incentives through stock options.\n   - **Stock Options**: Though Paragraph 417 shows director fees in cash, it does not specifically mention stock options. However, the existence of an incentive plan (Paragraph 395) supports the notion that there might be mechanisms in place involving equity incentives.\n   - **Agency Theory and Stakeholder Theory**: The document does not directly reference these theories. However, the primary goals of the Omnibus Incentive Plan include encouraging ownership and acting in shareholders' interests, which are principles aligned with both Agency Theory and Stakeholder Theory.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The document provides evidence of an incentive plan (Paragraph 395) aimed at aligning the interests of key personnel with those of the company and its shareholders, which can include stock options. The statement's reference to directors balancing incentives through stock options and aligning short-term achievements with long-term shareholder value is concordant with the general principles outlined in the Omnibus Incentive Plan.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

There is no mention of Circle K Denmark A/S or any other specific lessee.\n\n5. **Property carrying value**:\n   - No information is provided about the property carrying value or any changes to it in the given document.\n\nGiven the information in the financial document, we cannot find specific data to support or refute the statement about decreasing property carrying value by $7,753 due to foreign currency translation adjustments, nor the part about retaining full risk and benefits of ownership through an operating lease with Circle K Denmark A/S.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, the statement is refuted."

However, it increases the price per share and can dilute the proportionate ownership of individual shareholders.\n   - **Evaluation of Proposals**: The Special Committee concluded that Pegasus's proposals undervalued the company and were not in the best interest of shareholders.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**\n   - A 1-for-3 reverse stock split indeed increases the price per share and decreases the number of outstanding shares.\n   - This action typically does not increase the total number of authorized shares; it reduces them.\n   - The statement about increasing total authorized shares due to the reverse stock split is incorrect.\n   - The evaluation of Pegasus's proposals being deemed undervalued by the Special Committee is correct as per Paragraph 94.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   Given that the reverse stock split does not increase the total authorized shares but reduces the number of outstanding shares and that the proposals were deemed undervalued, the statement is partially correct regarding the evaluation but incorrect regarding the impact on authorized shares.\n\n   **Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

The statement incorrectly mentions that the shares were \"registered,\" which contradicts the point that they were \"not registered\" under the Securities Act as indicated in the transaction details. Using Section 4(2) implies an exemption from registration, not a registration under that section. Therefore, the usage of \"registered\" directly conflicts with the nature of the exemption.",

The statement also mentions that this was done under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, which allows for private placements without the need for public offering procedures. Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify relevant data in the document**: We need to look for any mention of common stock issuance or registration in the provided financial document.\n\n2. **Check the \"Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\" section**: This section mentions \"Gross proceeds from warrant exercises\" which could indicate the issuance of new shares. It shows $253,529 proceeds from warrant exercises, but it doesn't specify the number of shares.\n\n3. **Check the \"Stockholders' Equity\" section (paragraph id = 5 and 7)**: These sections detail changes in shares outstanding. In paragraph id = 5, we see:\n   - \"Exercise of warrants\" leading to an increase of 3,333,333 shares.\n   - This matches the number of shares mentioned in the statement we need to verify.\n\n4. **Check for evidence of private placement**: The statement mentions reliance on private placement principles, but the document does not explicitly state that these shares were registered under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. However, the lack of mention of a public offering may imply that the shares were indeed issued privately.\n\n**Conclusion**: While the document shows that 3,333,333 shares were issued due to the exercise of warrants, it does not explicitly state that these were registered under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. Therefore, the statement is not fully supported by the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

Enhancement in the company\u2019s solvency position.\n\nLet's go through each point step by step:\n\n### 1. Increase in Total Stockholders' Equity from 2022 to 2023\nTo verify this, we need to look at the values of stockholders' equity from the balance sheet for the years 2022 and 2023. However, the financial document provided does not include specific values for total stockholders' equity for these years.\n\n### 2. Decrease in Debt from 2022 to 2023\nTo verify this, we need to look at the values of debt from the balance sheet for the years 2022 and 2023. The financial document provides information on finance leases but does not provide a comprehensive view of total debt.\n\n### 3. Improvement in Leverage Ratios\nLeverage ratios typically compare debt to equity or debt to assets. Without the specific values of stockholders' equity and total debt, we cannot calculate these ratios.\n\n### 4. Asset Impairment due to Rapid Fleet Conversions\nThe document does mention asset impairment:\n- \"$14.7 million of equipment and capital spares were impaired in the fourth quarter of 2023 due to an accelerating trend toward rigs requiring 300 Series specifications.\"\n- There was also a $0.3 million impairment for a damaged piece of drilling equipment.\n\nThese impairments indicate that the rapid fleet conversions did lead to asset impairment.\n\n### 5. Enhancement in the Company\u2019s Solvency Position\nSolvency is typically measured using ratios like the debt-to-equity ratio or current ratio. Without the specific values for debt and equity, we cannot assess the solvency position directly.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the information provided in the financial document, we can conclude the following:\n\n- There is evidence of asset impairment due to rapid fleet conversions.\n- However, the document does not provide sufficient information to verify the increase in total stockholders' equity, the decrease in debt, the improvement in leverage ratios, or the enhancement in the company\u2019s solvency position.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted based on the provided financial document."

Operating expenses.\n3. Gross margin.\n\n**Step 1: Capitalization of software development costs**\n- The statement mentions a reduction in capitalization of software development. We can verify this by checking the \"Intangible Assets\" section for \"Software under development.\"\n  - As of November 30, 2023, the cost of software under development is $778,025.\n  - As of August 31, 2023, the cost of software under development is $624,539.\n  - This shows an increase in capitalization, not a reduction.\n\n**Step 2: Operating expenses**\n- The statement suggests that the reduction in capitalization led to lower operating expenses. However, the document states that \"the amortization of computer software in the current period resulted in a 7.0% increase in total operating expenses.\"\n  - Operating expenses for the three months ended November 30, 2023, were $753,394.\n  - Operating expenses for the three months ended November 30, 2022, were $637,092.\n  - This confirms an increase in operating expenses.\n\n**Step 3: Gross margin**\n- The statement also mentions an increased gross margin due to decreased staffing.\n  - Gross margin for the three months ended November 30, 2023, was 85.8%.\n  - Gross margin for the three months ended November 30, 2022, was 87.3%.\n  - This shows a decrease in gross margin, not an increase.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe statement claims that there was a reduction in capitalization of software development, decrease in operating expenses, and an increase in gross margin. However, the financial document shows that:\n- Capitalization of software development increased.\n- Operating expenses increased.\n- Gross margin decreased.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

            " Let's break down the provided financial document and analyze whether it supports the given statement:\n\n**Statement to verify:**\nIn 2023, Target Hospitality Corp. experienced a substantial reduction in the change in fair value of warrant liabilities by $40.8 million, primarily due to a shift from liability to equity treatment of private warrants, highlighting the impact of ASC 815-40 on the financial statements.\n\n### Steps of Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant financial data:**\n   - We need to look for the \"Change in fair value of warrant liabilities\" for the years 2022 and 2023 in the provided financial document.\n\n2. **Extract the necessary values:**\n   - From the provided document:\n     ```\n     Change in fair value of warrant liabilities\n     2023: ($9,062)\n     2022: $31,735\n     ```\n\n3. **Calculate the reduction in the change of fair value of warrant liabilities:**\n   - Reduction = Change in fair value of warrant liabilities in 2022 - Change in fair value of warrant liabilities in 2023\n   - Reduction = $31,735 - ($9,062)\n   - Reduction = $31,735 + $9,062\n   - Reduction = $40,797\n\n4. **Analyze the result:**\n   - The reduction in the change of fair value of warrant liabilities is approximately $40.8 million ($40,797 thousand), which matches the statement.\n\n5. **Evaluate the reason for the reduction:**\n   - The statement suggests that this significant decrease is due to a shift from liability to equity treatment of private warrants, highlighting the impact of ASC 815-40 (a financial accounting standard).\n   - The document does not explicitly mention ASC 815-40 or provide details on this shift. However, the reduction in the value is as stated.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe financial document supports the numerical part of the statement regarding the $40.8 million reduction in the change of fair value of warrant liabilities. However, the document does not explicitly address the reason for this change (shift from liability to equity treatment of private warrants and the impact of ASC 815-40).\n\nSince the numerical part of the statement is verified by the financial document, we can conclude:\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed** regarding the numerical reduction, but the specific reason mentioned in the statement is not explicitly supported by the document."

            " To assess the truthfulness of the statement, we need to identify and analyze the relevant data from the provided financial document. Let's proceed step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Relevant Data\n\n1. **Debt Restructuring Details**:\n   - The statement mentions an exchange of $181.4 million of 2024 Senior Secured Notes for 2025 Senior Secured Notes with a lower interest rate of 8.75%.\n\n2. **Financial Document**:\n   - While the document provides extensive financial data, it does not specifically mention a debt restructuring event or details about Senior Secured Notes.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Data\n\n1. **Debt Restructuring Mention**:\n   - The financial document does not explicitly mention any debt restructuring or exchange of debt notes occurring in 2023.\n\n2. **Debt-Related Information**:\n   - The document shows the following debt-related figures for 2023:\n     - Net income: $173,700\n     - Income tax expense: $51,050\n     - Interest expense, net: $22,639\n   - For 2022:\n     - Net income: $73,939\n     - Income tax expense: $32,370\n     - Interest expense, net: $36,323\n\n3. **Interest Expense Comparison**:\n   - There is a decrease in interest expense from $36,323 in 2022 to $22,639 in 2023.\n   - This decrease is consistent with a potential restructuring involving a lower interest rate.\n\n### Step 3: Assess the Accounting Principle\n\n1. **Net Present Value of Cash Flows**:\n   - The accounting principle of debt modification considers the net present value (NPV) of cash flows over the new debt\u2019s life. This would involve calculating the NPV using the new interest rate (8.75%) and comparing it to the carrying value of the original debt.\n   - Without explicit details about the restructuring or the new cash flows, we cannot compute the NPV.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nThe provided financial document does not explicitly mention a debt restructuring involving $181.4 million of 2024 Senior Secured Notes for 2025 Senior Secured Notes. While there is a decrease in interest expense that could support the idea of debt restructuring, the lack of explicit information prevents us from verifying the details of the restructuring and its alignment with the accounting principle of debt modification.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

The statement is incorrect because it indicates that all officers are automatically related parties due to beneficial ownership, which contradicts the context.

For cash transactions, the price per share isn\u2019t directly specified in the given sections. However, it appears there are multiple transactions at $0.0001 par value and additional considerations (such as cash-equivalent amounts).

Specific impacts on cash flows from the EB-5 program aren\u2019t singly highlighted but are part of the broader financing activities amounting to a net cash provided by financing activities of $4,584,750.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- The number of shares issued under the EB-5 Program differs significantly (2,874,970 shares vs. 1.26 million shares).\n- The issue price per share is not directly specified at $39.99 in the provided document.\n- The fair value change of assets is also much lower than $30 million.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted by the document as the details do not align with the provided financial data.\n\n**Conclusion: Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

Paragraph 175 clarifies that the fair value determination involves Level 3 inputs as it relies on unobservable inputs, including internally generated projections and risk assessments. 3. The concept of Level 3 Fair Value Measurements is important in this context as it involves significant management judgment and estimates, which are crucial for assessing whether goodwill's carrying value exceeds its fair value. 4.

However, the provided document does not directly state current assets or current liabilities.

However, the document does not provide explicit information about the change in fair value of equity security investments between 2022 and 2023. Therefore, we cannot verify this part of the statement based on the given data.\n\n2. **Strategic shift towards higher levels of long-term investments:**\n   - The document does not provide specific information about a strategic shift towards long-term investments. However, we can observe changes in interest and dividends income to infer possible shifts in investment strategy.\n\n3. **Increased short-term interest rates:**\n   - The document does not directly mention short-term interest rates. However, we can analyze the reported interest and dividends income to gauge the impact of potential interest rate changes.\n\n4. **Boost in interest and dividends income:**\n   - The statement claims a $4.4 million increase in interest and dividends income over the previous year. We can verify this by comparing the interest and dividends income for 2023 and 2022.\n\n   From the Consolidated Statements of Operations:\n   - Interest and dividends income for 2023: $9,055 (thousands)\n   - Interest and dividends income for 2022: $4,704 (thousands)\n\n   Calculation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Increase in interest and dividends income} = 9,055 - 4,704 = 4,351 \\text{ (thousands)}\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the increase in interest and dividends income is approximately $4.351 million (rounded to $4.4 million), which matches the claim in the statement.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The document does not provide enough information to support the claim about the $21.0 million decrease in the fair value of equity security investments.\n- The claim about a strategic shift towards higher levels of long-term investments is not directly supported by the document.\n- The increase in interest and dividends income is verified by the document, showing an increase of $4.4 million.\n\nSince the statement includes claims that cannot be fully verified by the provided document, the statement is refuted based on the available information.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

The statement incorrectly asserts there was negligible uncertainty in collectability and that a full valuation allowance was not recorded.

However, it mentions \"Currency effects\" under the Commercial Vehicle segment, which could be indicative of external economic influences. Let's keep this in mind as we proceed.\n\n2. **Gross Margins**: The document does not provide direct information about gross margins. However, it does provide EBITDA margins for the Commercial Vehicle segment. EBITDA margin is a good indicator of operational efficiency and can give us some insight into the gross margin trend.\n\nHere's the data for the Commercial Vehicle segment:\n\n|   | 2022 | 2023 |\n|---|---|---|\n| Sales | $1,979 | $2,092 |\n| EBITDA | $43 | $87 |\n| EBITDA Margin | 2.2% | 4.2% |\n\nFrom this data, we can see that the EBITDA margin for the Commercial Vehicle segment increased from 2.2% in 2022 to 4.2% in 2023. This increase suggests that the company's cost structure in this segment improved, rather than worsened.\n\n3. **Light Vehicle Segment**: The document does not provide EBITDA margins for the Light Vehicle segment.

Without the exact EBITDA margin, we cannot definitively say whether the gross margin decreased, but the increase in EBITDA despite lower sales suggests that the cost structure may have improved.\n\nBased on the provided data, we do not see evidence of a decline in gross margins in the Light Vehicle and Commercial Vehicle segments.

The monetization plan is intended to strengthen the company\u2019s balance sheet amidst a challenging fiscal start.\n2. Paragraph 100 notes that the company's liquidity position is supported by net cash provided by operations and sale-leaseback transactions among other strategies.

The company recognized a $6.3 million gain from interest rate swaps as cost of sales.\n2. This aligns with reclassifications from OCI.\n3. There was a decreased net asset position for these derivatives.\n4. Expectations of market adjustments.\n\nLet's break down the data:\n\n1. **Interest Rate Swap Agreements:**\n   - Amount of Gain recognized in OCI: $1.9 million for 2023.\n   - Location of Gain reclassified from OCI: Interest expense.\n   - Amount Reclassified from OCI: $6.3 million for 2023.\n\n### Step 3: Assess Each Part of the Statement\n1. **$6.3 million gain recognition**: The document shows $6.3 million reclassified from OCI into income under interest expense, not cost of sales.\n2. **Alignment with reclassifications from OCI**: The document confirms that $6.3 million was reclassified from OCI.\n3. **Decreased net asset position**: The document does not provide explicit information about the net asset position of derivatives.\n4. **Expectations of market adjustments**: This is an interpretive aspect not directly verifiable from the provided data.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis:\n1. The gain of $6.3 million was reclassified under \"Interest Expense,\" not \"Cost of Sales.\"\n2. The document does not mention a decreased net asset position.\n3.

            " To assess the truthfulness of the given statement, we need to analyze the provided financial document and identify relevant information related to the acquisition process, the usage of the trust fund, and the implications for original shareholders.\n\n### Step 1: Read the Provided Document\nCarefully read through the provided paragraphs to identify relevant financial data or facts.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Relevant Information\nParagraphs 12, 39, 47, 66, and 141 provide information about the financial position, flexibility in business combinations, conversion/tender rights, risks, and conflicts of interest.\n\n#### Paragraph 12:\n- **Key Information:** Mentions the flexibility in using cash, debt, or equity securities for business combinations.\n- **Relevance:** Indicates the company has various options for financing a business combination, including the possibility of using cash held in the trust account.\n\n#### Paragraph 39:\n- **Key Information:** Discusses the difficulties and risks associated with simultaneous acquisitions.\n- **Relevance:** This does not directly address the issue of shareholder ownership but highlights complications that could arise from multiple business combinations.\n\n#### Paragraph 47:\n- **Key Information:** Discusses conversion rights of public shareholders and mentions that initial shareholders have agreed not to convert their shares.\n- **Relevance:** Indicates that initial shareholders' agreement not to convert their shares could affect their ownership percentage post-transaction.\n\n#### Paragraph 66:\n- **Key Information:** Describes risks to unaffiliated investors in the context of a business combination.\n- **Relevance:** Discusses potential impacts on shareholders but does not provide specific details on how new shares would affect majority ownership.\n\n#### Paragraph 141:\n- **Key Information:** Lists potential conflicts of interest, including the impact on initial shareholders if a business combination is not completed.\n- **Relevance:** Mentions that initial shareholders' shares would be worthless if a business combination is not completed, indicating a strong motivation to complete a transaction.\n\n### Step 3: Document the Reasoning Process\nBased on the analysis:\n1. **Flexibility in Financing (Paragraph 12):** The company can use cash from the trust fund for business combinations.\n2. **Initial Shareholders' Agreement (Paragraph 47):** Initial shareholders have agreed not to convert their shares, which could affect their ownership percentage if new shares are issued.\n3. **Risks to Unaffiliated Investors (Paragraph 66):** While not directly relevant, it indicates that shareholders may face risks associated with the business combination.\n4. **Conflicts of Interest (Paragraph 141):** Mentions the potential for initial shareholders' shares to become worthless, suggesting a high motivation to complete a transaction.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude the Analysis\nThe statement suggests that acquiring a 100% stake in a target business exceeding the 80% trust fund requirement while issuing new shares will always ensure original shareholders maintain majority ownership. However, the document does not provide explicit information on the impact of new shares on the ownership percentage or the specific mechanisms ensuring majority ownership for original shareholders. The document does indicate that initial shareholders have significant motivation to complete a business combination but does not guarantee majority ownership.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted** based on the lack of explicit support for maintaining majority ownership for original shareholders in the provided document."

Paragraph 224 confirms that the company paid $44.4 million in cash for the $45 million repurchase, implying a strategic decision involving a financial saving off the principal amount.\n3. Understanding Convertible Debt Management, companies often strategically repurchase convertible notes at a discount to curtail interest obligations, hence managing liquidity effectively while reducing overall financial liabilities.\n4. Applying Interest Rate Risk concepts, the company's action may also be aimed at mitigating the risk of increasing interest costs in the event of fluctuating market rates, thereby stabilizing future financial performance.\n5. The statement erroneously claims that the company repurchased $44.4 million of its Convertible Notes; however, it was $45 million that was repurchased while the cash paid was $44.4 million.

            " To verify the given statement, we need to analyze the relevant financial document, particularly focusing on the paragraphs that discuss the redemption of public shares, liquidation procedures, and potential liabilities for stockholders. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Key Sections:**\n    - Paragraphs [83] and [95] discuss the redemption of public shares, liquidation if no initial business combination is completed, and potential stockholder liabilities.\n\n2. **Redemption and Liquidation:**\n    - Paragraph [83] states that if the company does not complete its initial business combination by the Termination Date, it will liquidate and redeem the public shares. The redemption price will be based on the funds in the trust account, and the company will dissolve and liquidate subject to its obligations under Delaware law.\n\n3. **Stockholder Liability:**\n    - Paragraph [95] explains stockholder liability under the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL). It mentions that stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received during a dissolution. The liability is limited to the lesser of the stockholder\u2019s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and the liability is barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.\n\n4. **Specific Requirements Under DGCL:**\n    - Paragraph [95] references Section 280 of the DGCL, which sets out procedures to ensure that the corporation makes reasonable provision for all claims against it. These procedures include specific timeframes for third-party claims and the corporation's response.\n\n5. **Statement Analysis:**\n    - The statement mentions potential liability beyond six years due to not following dissolution procedures under Section 281(b) of the DGCL and potential extension of liability under Section 174 to ten years if the redemption distribution is deemed unlawful.\n    - However, the document does not mention Section 281(b) or Section 174 specifically. It focuses on Section 280, which has different timeframes and liability limitations.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n    - Since the document does not discuss Sections 281(b) or 174, and it explicitly states that stockholder liability is barred after the third anniversary of dissolution, the provided statement about potential liability extending beyond six years or up to ten years is not supported by the document.\n\nTherefore, the statement is refuted."

It attributes this to a focus on high grant-date fair value RSU issuances and suggests it does not significantly impact financial statements under fair value accounting conventions.\n\n2. **Examining the Financial Document**:\n   - **Paragraph 154**: Provides details on stock-based compensation expenses but does not mention the specific unrecognized expenses or amounts related to nonvested RSUs and PSUs.\n   - **Paragraph 183**: Irrelevant to the statement as it pertains to property, plant, equipment, and water programs.\n   - **Paragraph 224**: Details the granting and vesting schedule of 825,000 RSUs, including vesting upon certain milestones and cancellations.\n   - **Paragraph 227**: Describes the issuance of 450,000 PSUs with vesting dependent on price hurdles and stock price achievements.\n   - **Paragraph 229**: Contains a summary of RSU activity for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, including the number of nonvested shares and their fair values.\n\n3. **Analyzing Relevant Data**:\n   - From **Paragraph 229**, we can see the data on nonvested shares at December 31, 2023:\n     - Nonvested at December 31, 2022: 543,624 shares with an average fair value of $8.90.\n     - Granted in 2023: 603,884 shares with an average fair value of $3.85.\n     - Forfeited or canceled in 2023: 90,315 shares with an average fair value of $10.75.\n     - Vested in 2023: 468,116 shares with an average fair value of $7.19.\n     - Nonvested at December 31, 2023: 589,077 shares with an average fair value of $4.80.\n\n   - **Calculation of Unrecognized Stock Compensation Expense**:\n     - The nonvested shares at December 31, 2023, have a fair value of $4.80 each.\n     - Total unrecognized expense = 589,077 shares * $4.80/share = $2,832,573.60.\n\n4. **Comparison with the Statement**:\n   - The calculated unrecognized stock compensation expense as of December 31, 2023, is $2,832,573.60, which is significantly higher than the $315,000 mentioned in the statement.\n   - The statement's claim about the amount being due to a \"strategic focus on high grant-date fair value RSU issuances\" is not substantiated by the provided data. The fair value of $4.80 per share is not particularly high compared to previous years' values.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   The statement claiming a $315,000 unrecognized stock compensation expense is incorrect based on the financial document. The actual calculated unrecognized expense is much higher.\n\n   **Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

We will focus on identifying any information related to Corsair Gaming's dependency on gaming hardware innovation, strategic alliances, and the effects of cross-elasticity within the gaming hardware ecosystem.\n\n### Step 1: Identify information related to dependency on gaming hardware\nThe financial document mentions that Corsair generates a significant portion of its net revenue from gaming-related products (paragraph 74). This indicates a dependency on the gaming industry. The document also discusses potential risks associated with declines or slowdowns in the gaming industry, as well as the migration of gamers to mobile devices, which could adversely affect their business.\n\n### Step 2: Identify information related to strategic alliances\nThe document does not explicitly mention any strategic alliances. However, it does mention that they have no specific plans to attract gamers who use only mobile devices or tablets, nor do they have plans to develop products specifically for these platforms. This suggests a lack of strategic alliances aimed at diversifying their product portfolio towards mobile gaming.\n\n### Step 3: Identify information related to cross-elasticity effects\nCross-elasticity effects in the context of the gaming hardware ecosystem refer to the interdependence between different segments of the gaming market, such as PC, console, and mobile gaming. The document discusses the potential migration of gamers from PCs and consoles to mobile devices and tablets, which could harm their business. This implies an awareness of cross-elasticity effects within the gaming hardware ecosystem.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Dependency on gaming hardware innovation**: The document clearly states that Corsair Gaming relies heavily on the gaming industry for a significant portion of its net revenue. Any decline in the gaming industry could materially and adversely affect their business.\n- **Strategic alliances**: The document does not provide information on strategic alliances. However, it mentions that Corsair has no plans to cater to the mobile gaming market, which could be seen as an absence of strategic alliances in that segment.\n- **Cross-elasticity effects**: The document acknowledges the potential for gamers to migrate to mobile devices, indicating an awareness of cross-elasticity effects within the gaming hardware ecosystem.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement suggests that a decline in gaming hardware innovation would negate the need for strategic alliances due to cross-elasticity effects. However, the document does not provide explicit evidence that Corsair Gaming is considering or negating the need for strategic alliances based on cross-elasticity effects. Instead, it highlights the risks associated with the gaming industry and the lack of plans to cater to the mobile gaming market.\n\nTherefore, the statement is not directly supported or refuted by the provided financial document. The document does not address the specific relationship between a decline in gaming hardware innovation and the need for strategic alliances.\n\n**Therefore, the statement is refuted.**"

            " To verify the statement, we need to analyze the provided financial document and identify information related to working capital deficit, currency translation, and the effectiveness of the company's disclosure controls. Let's proceed step by step:\n\n1. **Working Capital Deficit Increase:**\n   Working capital is calculated as Current Assets - Current Liabilities.\n   - For December 31, 2023: Working Capital = $109,197 (Current Assets) - $348,158 (Current Liabilities) = -$238,961\n   - For June 30, 2023: Working Capital = $106,002 (Current Assets) - $219,899 (Current Liabilities) = -$113,897\n   - The increase in working capital deficit is $238,961 - $113,897 = $125,064.\n\n2. **Currency Translation:**\n   - The document mentions \"Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment\" under the \"Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\" for different periods, indicating the presence of currency translation effects.\n\n3. **Disclosure Controls:**\n   - The financial document provides detailed financial statements and notes, including segment results, and clearly presents the impact of various factors like foreign currency translation adjustments.\n\n4. **Impact of Debt:**\n   - The document shows changes in liabilities, including an increase in the current portion of notes payable from $6,930 to $127,029, and a corresponding decrease in long-term liabilities from $127,029 to $0.\n   - The extent of debt (liabilities) is clearly disclosed, showing both current and long-term liabilities.\n\nGiven these points, the document shows a significant increase in the working capital deficit, mentions currency translation adjustments, and provides detailed disclosures about the company's financial situation, including the impact of debt.\n\n**Conclusion:** The statement is entailed by the document because the document confirms a significant working capital deficit increase, mentions currency translation adjustments, and demonstrates clear disclosure controls regarding the impact of debt on financial stability.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **entailed**."

Let's check the signatures section to see if this requirement is met.\n\n**Signatures Section:**\n```\nSIGNATURES\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.\nDESTINY MEDIA TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\n\n| By: | /s/Frederick Vandenberg |\n| Frederick Vandenberg |\n| Chief Executive Officer, President |\n| (Principal Executive Officer) |\n| Date: January 16, 2024 |\n| By: | /s/ Olya Massalitina |\n| Olya Massalitina |\n| Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer |\n| (Principal Financing and Accounting Officer) |\n```\nThe signatures section shows that both the CEO and the CFO have certified the accuracy of the financial statements, which is in compliance with SOX.\n\n#### Point 2: Only the Chief Executive Officer certifies the accuracy of financial statements\nThe document shows that both the CEO (Frederick Vandenberg) and the CFO (Olya Massalitina) have certified the financial statements. This contradicts the statement that only the CEO certifies the accuracy of the financial statements.\n\n#### Point 3: No unregistered sales of equity securities\nThe document does not provide explicit information about unregistered sales of equity securities. However, the absence of such information does not necessarily imply that there are no unregistered sales. This point cannot be conclusively verified or refuted based on the provided document.\n\n#### Point 4: No defaults on senior securities\nThe document does not provide explicit information about defaults on senior securities. Similar to the previous point, the absence of such information does not necessarily imply that there are no defaults. This point cannot be conclusively verified or refuted based on the provided document.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe statement that \"Destiny Media Technologies demonstrates a strong commitment to corporate governance through compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act by having only the Chief Executive Officer certify the accuracy of financial statements, although the company has no unregistered sales of equity securities or defaults on senior securities\" is refuted by the financial document.

Paragraph 300 describes the use of variable consideration for customer incentives and how significant judgments are applied, using factors like historical data and expected future purchases. This matters in financial forecasting and is crucial for transaction pricing.\n2. Paragraph 303 mentions that 18.2% of Corsair's net revenue is received in foreign currencies, highlighting exposure to foreign exchange risk.\n3. Paragraph 318 explains the complexity in auditing transaction prices influenced by variable consideration and historical return rates, emphasizing the significant judgment required.\n4. Paragraph 306 provides a quantitative perspective on foreign currency risks by stating that a 10% change in exchange rates impacts gains or losses by $1.9 million.\n5. Combining these points, one can see the complexity in predicting accurate financial outcomes due to both variable incentives and foreign currency factors, underlining the difficulty in precise financial forecasting when both elements are volatile.\n6. The statement is incorrect because it inaccurately reports that 25% of net revenue is denominated in foreign currencies, whereas it is actually 18.2%. Furthermore, it misstates the impact of a 10% fluctuation in exchange rates; the correct value is $1.9 million, not $1.5 million. This misinterpretation can lead to inaccurate assessments of foreign currency exposure and financial forecasting risks.",

            " Let's break down the statement into its key components and analyze each part against the provided financial document:\n\n1. **Variable consideration from customer incentives is a critical audit matter:**\n   - The document mentions \"Accrued reserves for customer incentive programs\" under \"Other liabilities and accrued expenses\" but does not explicitly state that it is a critical audit matter.\n\n2. **25% of net revenue is denominated in foreign currencies:**\n   - The document does not provide a specific percentage of net revenue denominated in foreign currencies.\n\n3. **A 10% fluctuation in exchange rates would approximately impact the net gain or loss on foreign currency contracts by $1.5 million:**\n   - The document does not provide details about the impact of a 10% fluctuation in exchange rates on the net gain or loss on foreign currency contracts.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Variable Consideration from Customer Incentives:\n- The document does not discuss the criticality of variable consideration from customer incentives as an audit matter. It only mentions customer incentives in the context of accrued reserves.\n\n#### Foreign Currency Revenues:\n- The document does not specify the percentage of net revenue denominated in foreign currencies or any impact of foreign currency fluctuations on net gain or loss.\n\n#### Impact of Exchange Rate Fluctuations:\n- The document provides details about the \"Effect of foreign currency exchange rates\" on specific assets such as \"GamingComponentsandSystems\" but does not link this to net revenue or provide the impact of a 10% fluctuation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the provided financial document, the statement cannot be supported. The document neither confirms that variable consideration from customer incentives is a critical audit matter nor provides specific information about the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on net revenue or the net gain or loss on foreign currency contracts.\n\nTherefore, the statement is **refuted**."

Paragraph 148 outlines the interest rate conditions for borrowings under the Credit Facility, linking them to market rates and adding a margin, setting the baseline for financial obligations incurred if borrowing occurs.\n2. Paragraph 149 details that 80% of certain revenues and 80% or 60% of accounts receivable form the borrowing base, subject to audits, ensuring liquidity coverage for the covenants mentioned in Paragraph 150.\n3. Paragraph 150 discusses covenants under the Credit Facility, which restrict certain financial activities, including incurring additional indebtedness or repurchasing shares without meeting specified criteria.\n4. Paragraph 151 states there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility at key fiscal periods, implying the company managed its capital to avoid breaching covenants that might otherwise force borrowing.\n5. Paragraph 154 clarifies the cash flows used in financing activities. The primary cash outflow in 2023 was to repay $42.3 million in long-term debt, indicating careful financial management to meet covenant obligations without using the credit line.\n6. Paragraph 157 notes that the company\u2019s interest rate risk was minimal, indicating that payment strategies focused more on credit covenants than on interest cost considerations. Integrating debt covenants understanding with cash flows shows their strategy was more about fulfilling financial obligations than managing exposure to increasing interest rates.\n7. The statement incorrectly suggests a significant impact from interest rate exposure and minimal repayments on long-term debt, which contradicts Paragraphs 154 and 157. Paragraph 154 confirms substantial debt repayment of $42.3 million, and Paragraph 157 asserts minimal interest rate risk.
