Profound advancements in oncology drug development have expanded the treatment options available to cancer patients, yet the need for additional treatment options exists. Our preclinical program, CTIM-76, is an anti-Claudin 6 (\u201cCLDN6\u201d) x anti-CD3 bispecific antibody (\u201cbsAb\u201d) that is intended to redirect T-cell-mediated lysis toward malignant cells expressing CLDN6. CLDN6 is a tight junction membrane protein target expressed in multiple solid tumors and absent from or expressed at low levels in healthy adult tissues. CTIM-76 investigational new drug (\u201cIND\u201d)-enabling studies are ongoing, with an IND filing to support human clinical trials expected by the end of March 2024. We plan to initiate a Phase 1 trial to focus on CLDN6-positive gynecologic and testicular cancers upon receiving IND clearance from the FDA. We expect to have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations into late 2024. We will require additional funding for our planned Phase 1 trial, other research and development expenditures, and general and administrative expenses.",

Although epigenetically silenced in healthy adult human tissues, CLDN6 expression has been found across a broad range of cancer tissues and can lead to a poor prognosis.

As a consequence, broad T cell activation can lead to significant and sometimes lethal side effects. Therefore, to harness the potential of cytotoxic T cells, therapeutic strategies seek to pair T cell activation with drug targets that are restricted to cancer tissue so as to avoid unwanted toxicity. CLDN6 expression is restricted to various cancer types (i.e., a tumor specific antigen or TSA), making it an ideal target to help T cells recognize and eliminate cancer cells. Recently, a class of bispecific antibodies (TSAxCD3) with a native immunoglobulin format has emerged that can efficiently trigger T-cell-mediated killing of tumor cells by linking a T cell to a tumor cell and activating the CD3/T cell receptor complex, as shown above.",

CLDN6 is expressed on multiple solid tumors such as ovarian, endometrial, lung and testicular. As shown below, CTIM-76 exhibits excellent selectivity and specificity for CLDN6. Preclinical studies of CTIM-76 show it effectively maintains a strong tumor binding property and anti-tumor activity attributable to a synergistic effect of both CLDN6 binding and CD3 binding while avoiding systemic immunotoxicity commonly seen with CD3 antibodies as a drug class. CTIM-76 has the potential for convenient dosing and scalable manufacturing to address the significant number of patients who are potentially eligible for CTIM-76 therapy.",

In the assay, cytokine production was evaluated in the exogenous (CLDN6-K562) cell line model at 48 hours.

Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our technology or product candidates and could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our product candidates, technology, inventions and improvements. We cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products, the methods of use or manufacture of those products. Moreover, even our issued patents may not guarantee us the right to commercialize our product candidates, if approved. Patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and uncertainties. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and practicing our proprietary product candidates, and our issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for our product candidates. Moreover, such third parties may obtain damages against us, which could require us to make commercially reasonable royalty payments, payments for lost profits, or other damages, costs and expenses. In addition, the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar products that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect to our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any patent protection for such product may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides.",
