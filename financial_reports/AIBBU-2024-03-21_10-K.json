As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to a traditional initial public offering through a merger or other Business Combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their stock, shares or other equity interests in the target business for our Ordinary Shares or for a combination of our Ordinary Shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration used in the transaction to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe that target businesses might find this avenue a more certain and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than a typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, roadshow and public reporting efforts that will likely not be present to the same extent in connection with a Business Combination with us. Furthermore, once the Business Combination is consummated, the target business will have effectively become a public company, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters\u2019 ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders\u2019 interests than it would have as a privately-held company. Public company status can offer further benefits by enhancing a company\u2019s profile among potential new customers and vendors and attracting talented employees. While we believe that our status as a public company will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view the inherent limitations in our status as a blank check company as a deterrent and may prefer to effect a Business Combination with a more established entity or with a private company. These limitations include constraints on our available financial resources, which may be inferior to those of other entities pursuing the acquisition of similar target businesses; the requirement that we seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer in relation thereto, which may delay the consummation of a transaction; and the existence of our outstanding rights, which may represent a source of future dilution.",

The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1 % of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the \u201cTreasury\u201d) has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax.
