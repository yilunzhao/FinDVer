The other four\u2014iridium, rhodium, ruthenium and osmium\u2014are produced only as co-products of platinum and palladium. PGMs are known for their purity, high melting points and unique catalytic properties. In addition to their oxidation and reduction properties, they are also extremely resistant to corrosion. PGMs are utilized in a number of industrial processes, technologies and commercial applications. Their unique chemical and physical properties make PGMs an excellent raw material, catalyst and ingredient for manufacturing processes. Consumer and industrial products made with palladium and other PGMs include flat panel monitors, glass fiber, medical tools, computer hard drives, nylon and razors, among others. PGMs play a critical role in autocatalysis and pollution control in the automotive sector.",

Rising palladium prices tempered in 2011, but concerns over supply shortages due to labor problems at mines in South Africa and dwindling Russian stocks provided some price support into mid-2012. Palladium rose to a 13 year high of $907 per ounce in September 2014, a 27% increase from the start of the year. The rally was driven by supply side concerns following the longest strike in South African mining history and escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine. The strong rally in 2014 was completely unwound in 2015, when South African mine supply resumed back to pre-strike levels and pessimism about industrial demand in China overwhelmed the true tightness in the market. Palladium was then the top performer of the precious metals complex for 3 consecutive years from 2017 to 2019, where it rose nearly 182% from $676 per troy ounce on December 31, 2016 to $1,905 per troy ounce on December 31, 2019. The price of palladium reached an all-time high of $2,781/oz on February 19, 2020, before closing out the year at a price of $2,342/oz on December 31, 2020. Similar to other precious metals, palladium took a step back in 2021 as it returned -16% (as of December 31, 2021).

While each of the precious metals (Gold, Silver, Platinum) saw prices fluctuate throughout the year, the price of palladium showed greater correlation with the price of Platinum during the first quarter.

On June 14th, 2022 the price of palladium fell as low as $1,810 per ounce, as aggressive interest rate policies from the U.S. Federal Reserve drove the U.S. Dollar higher. Contrary to the other three precious metals, the price of palladium increased as high as $2,315 per ounce on October 4th, 2022, as supplies were further constrained by operational challenges in South African and North American mines, as well as a weaker automotive recycling market. Throughout the year, tailwinds from supply disruptions were countered by weaker automotive and investment demand, higher interest rates and the risk of a potential recession. As a result, while the other three precious metals rallied to end the year, the price of palladium reversed course during the fourth quarter to end the year at $1,775 per ounce, down 10% from the end of 2021.",

Russian production was relatively flat compared to 2020 and 2021, however sanctions imposed in 2022 constrained the production capacity of Russian metals producer Nornickel, the world\u2019s largest palladium producer. In contrast, South Africa continues to experience power supply disruptions along with rising electricity prices. Coupled with labor strikes, political instability, inflation and volatile prices, which have compressed profit margins and subsequently led to a decrease in expected supply from the world\u2019s second leading producer. However, despite the supply deficit, investors have sold short a large amount of palladium this year, in hopes that electric vehicles will curtail the demand for palladium in gasoline-powered automobiles. Additionally, while a positive outlook at the beginning of the year, fueled by China\u2019s loosening of COVID-19 related restrictions, drove the price as high as $1,628 per ounce on April 21, 2023, the Chinese economic rebound disappointed investors.

The COMEX is the largest exchange in the world for trading precious metals futures and options and launched palladium futures in 1968, followed with options in 2010. The TOCOM has been trading palladium since 1992. Trading on these exchanges is based on fixed delivery dates and transaction sizes for the futures and options contracts traded. Trading costs are negotiable. As a matter of practice, only a small percentage of the futures market turnover ever comes to physical delivery of the palladium represented by the contracts traded. Both exchanges permit trading on margin. Margin trading can add to the speculative risk involved given the potential for margin calls if the price moves against the contract holder. The COMEX trades palladium futures almost continuously (with one short break in the evening) through its CME Globex electronic trading system and clears through its central clearing system. On June 6, 2003, the TOCOM adopted a similar clearing system. In each case, the exchange acts as a counterparty for each member for clearing purposes.",

For example, the 2008 financial credit crisis resulted in significantly depressed prices of palladium largely due to forced sales and deleveraging from institutional investors such as hedge funds and pension funds as expectations of economic growth slumped.

Any United States, New York or other court situated in the United States may have difficulty interpreting English law (which, insofar as it relates to custody arrangements, is largely derived from court rulings rather than statute), LPPM rules or the customs and practices in the London custody market.
