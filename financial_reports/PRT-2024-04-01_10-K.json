Under CERCLA, these \u201cresponsible persons\u201d may include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and entities that transport, dispose of or arrange for the transport or disposal of hazardous substances released at the site. These responsible persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. On September 6, 2022, EPA designated two per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (\u201cPFAS\u201d) as hazardous substances under CERCLA. PFAS chemicals are known as \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because of their persistence in the environment. PFAS have been widely used in industrial and commercial applications since the 1950s, including the oil and gas industry, and their designation as a CERCLA hazardous substance increases potential risks of incurring CERCLA liabilities where they have been historically used. In April 2023, EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking asking the public for input regarding potential future hazardous substance designations of PFAS under CERCLA, and in June 2023, EPA released a framework for addressing new and new uses of PFAS under the Toxic Substances Control Act (\u201cTSCA\u201d).

These laws and regulations govern the generation, storage, treatment, transfer and disposal of wastes generated. Drilling fluids, produced waters and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil, natural gas and NGLs, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under RCRA and, instead, are regulated under RCRA\u2019s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. However, it is possible that certain oil, natural gas and NGL drilling and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, in December 2016, the EPA and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address the EPA\u2019s alleged failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil, natural gas and NGL wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. The consent decree required the EPA to propose a rulemaking no later than March 15, 2019, for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil, natural gas and NGL wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary (which deadline was extended to April 23, 2019, due to a lapse in appropriations). On April 23, 2019, EPA made a determination that revisions to the federal regulations for the management of exploration and production waste under Subtitle D of RCRA are not necessary and issued a report explaining the basis for its decision. In October 2023, EPA released a final rule that eliminated an exemption that allowed facilities to avoid reporting information on PFAS when those chemicals were used in small concentrations. In January 2024, the EPA announced the automatic addition of seven PFAS to the list of chemicals covered by the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), consistent with the Fiscal Year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, and in February 2024, EPA released two proposed regulations under RCRA, adding nine PFAS to the list of RCRA hazardous constituents. EPA stated it will continue to work to identify areas for regulatory improvements and to address emerging issues to ensure exploration and production wastes continue to be managed appropriately. Any future regulatory change due to emerging issues, a change in EPA determination, or otherwise could result in an increase in the costs to manage and dispose of wastes, which could increase the costs of Boaz Energy\u2019s operations.",

The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. Obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. In addition, federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations. On August 29, 2023, the EPA published a final rule clarifying the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States (\u201cWOTUS\u201d) and conforming the definition of WOTUS with the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation in its Sackett v. EPA decision. The scope of jurisdiction under the CWA includes (a) waters (i) currently used, or that were used in the past, or may be susceptible to use in interstate or foreign commerce, including all waters which are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide; (ii) the territorial seas; or (iii) interstate waters, and (b) only wetlands that have a \u201ccontinuous surface connection\u201d with those traditional waters. \u201cContinuous surface connection\u201d means when there is no clear demarcation between traditional \u201cwaters\u201d and wetlands, which is a narrower construction of applicable wetlands than years prior, thereby eliminating some of the wetlands previously covered. In the wake of the Sackett decision, several states have developed their own wetlands policies or regulatory programs to address discharges to intra-state waters that may no longer be regulated as WOTUS. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements imposed under the CWA require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of WOTUS in the event of a hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, or \u201cOPA,\u201d amends the CWA and establishes strict liability and natural resource damages liability for unauthorized discharges of oil into WOTUS. OPA requires owners or operators of certain onshore facilities to prepare Facility Response Plans for responding to a worst-case discharge of oil into WOTUS. EPA and various states also impose permitting requirements for the disposal of produced water by underground injection. As these requirements increase and become more strict, they could result in an increase in the costs to manage and dispose of wastes, which could increase the costs of Boaz Energy\u2019s operations.",

These laws and regulations may require Boaz Energy to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or incur development expenses to install and utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. For example, in June 2016 the EPA finalized rules regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting processes and requirements. In addition, EPA, New Mexico, Texas and other states have begun to regulate through their New Source Performance Standards (\u201cNSPS\u201d) and other air emissions programs the emission of VOCs and methane from oil and gas production process equipment, storage tanks and produced water impoundments and other assets. These requirements could increase the costs of development and production on the Underlying Properties, potentially impairing the economic development of the Underlying Properties and reducing the amount of cash distributable to Trust unitholders. Obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. Federal and state regulatory agencies may impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the CAA and associated state laws and regulations. As particularly related to the CAA, the EPA\u2019s National Enforcement and Compliance Initiatives for fiscal years 2024-2027, which were updated on August 17, 2023, continued some of its initiatives from fiscal year 2020-2023, including addressing hazardous air pollutant violations in communities already highly burdened with pollution impacts and to focus on chemical accident risk prevention under Section 112(r) of the CAA with a focus on anhydrous ammonia (mainly used as a fertilizer or a refrigerant) and hydrogen fluoride (used in petrochemical manufacturing). Reducing emissions from significant sources of volatile organic compounds (\u201cVOC\u201d) and hazardous air pollutants could lead to increased scrutiny of air emissions from oil and gas operations. Air toxin reporting is currently voluntary, but if it became mandatory, then there may be increased costs to Boaz Energy\u2019s operations. On November 21, 2023, EPA proposed to amend the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (\u201cNESHAPs\u201d) for oil and gas production facilities and for natural gas transmission and storage facilities to remove an affirmative defense based on emissions caused by malfunctions.

However, on August 28, 2019, the EPA published a notice of reconsideration proposing to rescind methane-specific requirements for new and modified oil and gas infrastructure, which drew legal challenges. Subsequently, on November 2, 2021, EPA released a proposed rule that would limit emissions of methane\u2014a greenhouse gas\u2014from facilities in the oil and gas sector. In November 2022, EPA published a supplemental proposed rule that will increase monitoring and mitigation requirements related to methane and VOC emissions from the oil and gas industry. The proposed regulations, once effective, would reach new and existing facilities in the production, gathering, processing, and transmission and storage segments. Notably, the Biden administration has made addressing climate change a priority and is expected to take steps to reduce harmful air emissions, which could result in new efforts to set methane limits and otherwise regulate GHGs. On December 2, 2023, EPA issued a final rule to reduce emissions of methane and other harmful pollutants from oil and gas operations. The rule added new NSPS standards to reduce methane and VOCs from oil and gas operations and developed a new \u201csuper emitter\u201d program. EPA has also proposed a new rule to establish a Waste Emission Charge that applies to methane emissions from certain oil and gas operations.",

The adoption and implementation of any international, federal or state legislation or regulations that require reporting of GHGs or otherwise restrict or place a fee or charge on emissions of GHGs could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions for Boaz Energy and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that oil and gas will continue to represent a major share of global energy use through 2040, and other private sector studies project continued growth in demand for the next two decades. However, recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector. Moreover, activist shareholders have introduced proposals that may seek to force companies to adopt aggressive emission reduction targets or to shift away from more carbon-intensive activities. While we cannot predict the outcomes of such proposals, they could make it more difficult for Boaz Energy to engage in exploration and production activities, ultimately reducing distributable cash to Trust unitholders. Finally, many scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHG in the atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climate events that could have an adverse effect on operations of the Underlying Properties and, as a result, the amount of cash distributable to Trust unitholders.",

In the event of material revisions, the Trustee reviews the impact of these revisions on the amortization of Trust Units and impairment estimates. During 2023, a material revision was made to reserves resulting in the additional recognition of amortization of Trust Units. The Trust recognized $4,164,943 of amortization of Trust Units for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The markets for crude oil and natural gas have a history of significant price volatility and though prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand. If events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, the Trustee would use the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows from the Net Profits Interest to evaluate the recoverability of the Trust assets. If the undiscounted future net cash flows from the Net Profits Interest are less than the Net Profits Interest carrying value, the Trust would recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the Net Profits Interest carrying value and the estimated fair value of the Net Profits Interest.

Although this basis of accounting is permitted for royalty trusts by the SEC, the financial statements of the Trust differ from financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP because net profits income is not accrued in the month of production, expenses are not recognized when incurred and cash reserves may be established for certain contingencies, and overpayments received do not need to be paid back and are instead taken from future payments that would not be recorded in GAAP financial statements.

The Trustee reviews the Trust\u2019s Net Profits Interest in oil and natural gas properties for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the Net Profits Interest may not be recoverable. In the event of material revisions, the Trustee reviews the impact of these revisions on the amortization of Trust Units and impairment estimates. During 2023, a material revision was made to reserves resulting in the additional recognition of amortization of Trust Units. The Trust recognized $4,164,943 of amortization of Trust Units for the year ended December 31, 2023. There was no impairment present for the year ended December 31, 2023, after revisions to undiscounted cash flows. There was also no impairment as of December 31, 2022. In general, neither the Trustee nor Boaz Energy view temporarily low prices as an indication of impairment. The markets for crude oil and natural gas have a history of significant price volatility and though prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand. If events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, the Trustee would use the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows from the Net Profits Interest to evaluate the recoverability of the Trust assets. If the undiscounted future net cash flows from the Net Profits Interest are less than the Net Profits Interest carrying value, the Trust would recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the Net Profits Interest carrying value and the estimated fair value of the Net Profits Interest. The determination as to whether the Net Profits Interest is impaired is based on the best information available to the Trustee at the time of the evaluation, including information provided by Boaz Energy such as estimates of future production and development and operating expenses.",

            "context": "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Unit Holders of PermRock Royalty Trust and Argent Trust Company, Trustee Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying statements of assets, liabilities, and trust corpus of PermRock Royalty Trust (the Trust) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related statements of distributable income and changes in trust corpus for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the assets, liabilities, and trust corpus of the Trust as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the distributable income and changes in trust corpus for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with the modified cash basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As described in Note 2 to the financial statements, these financial statements were prepared on the modified cash basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Trustee. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters. WEAVER AND TIDWELL, L.L.P. We have served as the Trust\u2019s auditor since 2018.

Organization of Trust PermRock Royalty Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d) is a Delaware statutory trust formed on November 22, 2017 under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act pursuant to a trust agreement dated November 22, 2017, as amended and restated on May 4, 2018, by and among Boaz Energy II, LLC (\u201cBoaz Energy\u201d), as trustor, Simmons Bank, as Trustee (as hereinafter defined), and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as Delaware Trustee (the \u201cDelaware Trustee\u201d) (such amended and restated trust agreement, as amended to date, the \u201cTrust Agreement\u201d). In accordance with the successor trustee provisions of the Trust Agreement, Argent Trust Company, as successor trustee of the Trust, is subject to all terms and conditions of the Trust Agreement. The defined term \u201cTrustee\u201d as used herein shall refer to Simmons Bank (which maintains its offices at 2200 West 7th Street, Suite 210, P.O. Box 470727, Fort Worth, Texas 76147) for periods prior to December 30, 2022, and shall refer to Argent Trust Company (which maintains its offices at 3838 Oak Lawn Ave, Suite 1720, Dallas, Texas 75219) for periods on and after December 30, 2022. The Trust was created to acquire and hold the Net Profits Interest for the benefit of the Trust unitholders. In connection with the closing of the initial public offering of Trust units, on May 4, 2018, Boaz Energy conveyed the Net Profits Interest to the Trust in exchange for Trust units pursuant to a conveyance agreement between Boaz Energy, the Trustee and the Delaware Trustee (the \u201cConveyance\u201d). The Net Profits Interest represents an interest in the Underlying Properties. The Net Profits Interest entitles the Trust to receive 80% of the net profits from the sale of oil and natural gas production from the Underlying Properties. The Net Profits Interest is passive in nature and neither the Trust nor the Trustee has any control over, or responsibility for, costs relating to the operation of the Underlying Properties. The Trust has and will continue to make monthly cash distributions of all of its monthly cash receipts, after deduction of fees and expenses for the administration of the Trust and any cash reserves, to holders of its Trust units as of the applicable record date on or before the 10th business day after the record date. Distributions generally relate to sales from a one-month period. The Trustee may deposit funds awaiting distribution in an account with an FDIC-insured or national bank, including the Trustee, if the interest paid to the Trust at least equals amounts paid by the Trustee on similar deposits, and make other short-term investments with the funds distributed to the Trust. In May 2018, Boaz Energy completed an initial public offering of 6,250,000 of the 12,165,732 total Trust units outstanding, retaining ownership of 5,915,732 Trust units. As of March 25, 2024, Boaz Energy owned 4,884,861 Trust units of the 12,165,732 Trust units issued and outstanding. 2. Trust Significant Accounting Policies a. Basis of Accounting The Trust uses the modified cash basis of accounting to report Trust receipts of the Net Profits Interest and payments of expenses incurred. The Net Profits Interest represents the right to receive revenues (primarily oil and natural gas sales), less direct operating expenses, lease operating expenses, severance and ad valorem taxes and development expenses of the Underlying Properties, multiplied by 80%. Cash distributions of the Trust are made based on the amount of cash received by the Trust pursuant to terms of the Conveyance creating the Net Profits Interest. Certain reclassifications of prior year\u2019s data have been made to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Trust\u2019s previously reported Distributable Income or Trust Corpus. 47 The financial statements of the Trust, as prepared on a modified cash basis, reflect the Trust\u2019s assets, liabilities, Trust corpus, earnings and distributions as follows: \u00b7 Income from the Net Profits Interest is recorded when distributions are received by the Trust; \u00b7 Distributions to Trust unitholders are recorded when declared by the Trust; \u00b7 Trust general and administrative expenses (which includes the Trustee\u2019s fees as well as accounting, printing, engineering, legal, tax advisory and other professional fees) are recorded when paid; cash reserves for Trust expenses may be established by the Trustee for certain expenditures that would not be recorded as contingent liabilities under United States generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d); \u00b7 Amortization of the investment in the Net Profits Interest is calculated on a unit-of-production basis and is charged directly to Trust corpus, and such amortization does not affect distributions from the Trust; and \u00b7 The Trust\u2019s investment in the Net Profits Interest is periodically assessed to determine whether its aggregate value has been impaired below its total capitalized cost basis. In general, neither the Trustee nor Boaz Energy view temporarily low prices as an indication of impairment. The markets for crude oil and natural gas have a history of significant price volatility and though prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand. If events and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, the Trustee would use the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows from the Net Profits Interest to evaluate the recoverability of the Trust assets. If the undiscounted future net cash flows from the Net Profits Interest are less than the Net Profits Interest carrying value, the Trust would recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the Net Profits Interest carrying value and the estimated fair value of the Net Profits Interest. The determination as to whether the Net Profits Interest is impaired is based on the best information available to the Trustee at the time of the evaluation, including information provided by Boaz Energy such as estimates of future production and development and operating expenses . \u00b7 In the event of material revisions, the Trustee reviews the impact of these revisions on the amortization of Trust Units and impairment estimates. During 2023, a material revision was made to reserves resulting in the additional recognition of amortization of Trust Units. The Trust recognized $4,164,943 of amortization of Trust Units for the year ended December 31, 2023. There was no impairment present for the year ended December 31, 2023, after revisions to undiscounted cash flows. There was also no impairment as of December 31, 2022. b. Financial Statements. The financial statements of the Trust are prepared on a modified cash basis of accounting, which is considered to be the most meaningful basis of preparation for a royalty trust because monthly distributions to the Trust unitholders are based on net cash receipts. Although this basis of accounting is permitted for royalty trusts by the SEC, the financial statements of the Trust differ from financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP because net profits income is not accrued in the month of production, expenses are not recognized when incurred and cash reserves may be established for certain contingencies that would not be recorded in GAAP financial statements. This comprehensive basis of accounting other than GAAP corresponds to the accounting permitted for royalty trusts by the SEC as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E, Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts. c. Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements requires the Trust to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimated future cash flows used to determine amortization and potential impairment of the investment in the Net Profits Interest are subject to change. d. Risks and Uncertainties. The Trust\u2019s revenue and distributions are substantially dependent upon the prevailing and future prices for oil and natural gas, each of which depends on numerous factors beyond the Trust\u2019s control such as economic conditions, the global political environment, regulatory developments and competition from other energy sources. Oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and may be subject to significant fluctuations in the future. e. Contingencies. Contingencies related to the Underlying Properties that are unfavorably resolved would generally be expected to result in reductions to cash receipts to the Trust in respect of the Net Profits Interest with corresponding reductions to cash distributions to Trust unitholders. Please see the discussion of litigation in Note 10. 3. Income Taxes Tax counsel advised the Trust at the time of formation that for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Trust is treated as a grantor trust and is not subject to federal income tax at the trust level. Trust unitholders are treated for such purposes as owning a direct interest in the assets of the Trust, and each Trust unitholder is taxed directly on its pro rata share of the income and any gain, if sold, attributable to the assets of the Trust and is entitled to claim its pro rata share of deductions and expenses attributable to the assets of the Trust. Each Trust unitholder should consult his or her own tax advisor regarding income tax requirements, if any, applicable to such unitholder\u2019s ownership of Trust units. 48 4. Cash Reserves Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, beginning in May 2019, the Trustee was authorized to begin retaining cash from the distributions the Trust receives (i) in an amount not to exceed $1.0 million at any one time to be used by the Trust in the event that its cash on hand (including available cash reserves) is not sufficient to pay ordinary course administrative expenses as they become due and (ii) in such amounts as the Trustee in its discretion deems appropriate to pay for future liabilities of the Trust. Boaz Energy provided the Trust with a $1.0 million letter of credit (the \u201cLetter of Credit\u201d) that could be drawn by the Trust to pay administrative expenses of the Trust. The Trustee is permitted to retain cash from distributions in such amount as the Trustee determines but not less than $25,000 per month or more than $100,000 per month until the reserve described in clause (i) equals or exceeds $1.0 million, at which time, the Trustee is required to release the Letter of Credit. The Letter of Credit expired May 2, 2020, as the Trustee had retained a total of $1,000,000 in cash reserves. As of December 31, 2023, the Trustee continued to hold the previously retained $1,000,000 in cash reserves. Boaz Energy is entitled under the Conveyance to reserve up to $3 million from the net profits for certain taxes and development expenses. As of December 31, 2023, the balance of funds held back to cover certain future capital expenses was $650,157 net to the Trust. 5. Distributions to Unitholders The Trust makes monthly cash distributions of all of its monthly cash receipts, after deduction of fees and expenses for the administration of the Trust and any cash reserves, to holders of its Trust units as of the applicable record date on or before the 10th business day after the record date. Based on 12,165,732 Trust units outstanding at each date listed below, the monthly per unit distributions during the year ended December 31, 2023, were as follows: Record Date Payment Date Distribution per Unit January 31, 2023 February 14, 2023 $ 0.070629 February 28, 2023 March 14, 2023 0.060217 March 31, 2023 April 14, 2023 0.050260 April 28, 2023 May 12, 2023 0.030888 May 31, 2023 June 14, 2023 0.030013 June 30, 2023 July 17, 2023 0.040784 July 31, 2023 August 14, 2023 0.039689 August 31, 2023 September 15, 2023 0.040201 September 29, 2023 October 16, 2023 0.040626 October 31, 2023 November 14, 2023 0.040837 November 30, 2023 December 14, 2023 0.040302 December 29, 2023 January 16, 2024 0.030299 $ 0.514745 6. Related Party Transactions Trustee Administrative Fee. Under the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trust pays an annual administrative fee to the Trustee and Delaware Trustee. The Delaware Trustee\u2019s annual fee is $4,000. In 2023, the Trustee received $202,342 for the period from January through December 2023. For 2024, the Trustee\u2019s annual administrative fee will be approximately $205,031. The Trustee\u2019s annual administrative fee increased at a rate of 3% per year for the first three years of the Trust\u2019s existence, increased at a rate of 2% in 2022 and 2023. The Trustee\u2019s annual administrative fee will increase at a rate of 1% in 2024, will continue to increase at a rate of 1% each year until the 20th anniversary of the Trust\u2019s formation, and then will remain flat thereafter. These costs of the Trust, which are included in administration expenses, are deducted by the Trust before distributions are made to Trust unitholders. 49 Agreements with Boaz Energy. On May 4, 2018, the Trust entered into a registration rights agreement for the benefit of Boaz Energy and certain of its affiliates and transferees, pursuant to which the Trust agreed to register the offering of the Trust units held by Boaz Energy and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees upon request by Boaz Energy. The Trust filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 on April 28, 2022 (the \u201cRegistration Statement\u201d) seeking the registration of 5,801,675 Trust units held by Boaz Energy. The SEC confirmed the effectiveness of the Registration Statement on May 9, 2022. As of March 25, 2024, Boaz Energy owned 4,884,861 Trust units of the 12,165,732 units issued and outstanding. 7. Certain Contracts The Trust is not a party to any purchase, gathering, or processing contracts. Boaz Energy and other outside operators are parties to oil and natural gas sales contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2023, Boaz Energy reported that Phillips 66, Plains All American Pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, Blackbeard Operating LLC, and Enterprise Crude Oil LLC accounted for 29.93%, 20.82%, 17.07%, 11.61%, and 10.23% respectively, of its total oil and natural gas revenues, and that no other purchaser accounted for 10% or more of the total revenue of the Underlying Properties. Boaz Energy does not believe that the loss of any of these parties as a purchaser of crude oil or natural gas production from the Underlying Properties would have a material impact on the business or operations of Boaz Energy or the Underlying Properties because of the large number of marketing firms and competitive nature of oil and gas purchasers in the Permian Basin. Oil and natural gas are currently sold to these four customers under short-term contracts at market prices. 8. Significant Customers Information as to significant purchasers of oil and gas production attributable to the Trust\u2019s economic interests is included in Note 7, above. 9. Development Costs Boaz Energy\u2019s original 2023 capital expenditure estimate was $4.5 million. That budget was revised slightly by the end of 2023 to $4.4 million. Boaz Energy\u2019s capital projects in 2023 included participation in non-operated drilling and recompletion projects, as well as waterflood conformance and reactivations in Terry, Coke, Crane and Glasscock Counties. The cost of these capital projects were included in Boaz Energy\u2019s 2023 capital expenditure budget. Boaz Energy\u2019s estimated capital budget for 2024 for the Underlying Properties is $4.5 million, of which approximately $0.9 million has been expended as of March 13, 2024. Based on current oil and gas prices, Boaz anticipates continuing to participate in Crane and Glasscock Counties non-operated drilling and waterflood conformance and expansion work in Crane & Terry Counties, as well as drilling 1 new operated wells in Crane County sometime in 2024. The majority of capital spent in 2024 to date was spent on non-operated projects in the Permian Shelf Area. The $4.5 million estimate is subject to change based on, among other things, changes in the price of oil and natural gas, Boaz Energy\u2019s actual capital requirements, the pace of regulatory approvals and the mix of projects. 10. Settlements and Litigation On October 1, 2018, a lawsuit styled Thaleia L. Marston, Trustee of the Marston Trust v. Blackbeard Operating, LLC, et.al, No. 18-10-24761 \u2013 CVW in the 143rd District Court in Ward County, Texas (the \u201c2018 Litigation\u201d) was filed, naming, among others, Boaz Energy and the Trust as defendants. The plaintiff is a lessor under two leases operated by Blackbeard Operating LLC. The Underlying Properties include the interests of Boaz Energy in some of the minerals covered by those leases. The litigation sought surface use damages and alleged violations of the terms of the leases, among other things. The court had set a two-day bench trial to commence May 18, 2022, but on May 10, 2022, the court granted motions for summary judgment effectively disposing of the plaintiff\u2019s claims. At a status conference conducted on May 12, 2022, the plaintiff confirmed the court\u2019s rulings disposed of all the plaintiff\u2019s claims. The court held a hearing regarding attorneys\u2019 fees in June 2022. On May 12, 2023, the court entered its final judgment, incorporating its prior order granting the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and granting defendants\u2019 motion for attorneys\u2019 fees, but the plaintiff then filed a notice of appeal to the Eighth Court of Appeals in El Paso County, Texas. The plaintiff-appellants filed their opening brief on December 11, 2023; and the defendant-appellees filed an answer brief on February 22, 2024. 50 11. Supplemental Oil and Gas Reserve Information (Unaudited) Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves Proved oil and gas reserves have been estimated by independent petroleum engineers. Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulation before the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. Proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well. Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, such estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available. The reserves actually recovered and the timing of production of these reserves may be substantially different from the original estimate. Revisions result primarily from new information obtained from development drilling and production history and from changes in economic factors. The following table presents a reconciliation of proved reserve quantities attributable to the Trust as of the dates indicated below: Oil (MBbls) Natural Gas (MMcf) Total (MBoe) Balance, Proved Reserves as of December 31, 2021 2,956 2,569 3,384 Revisions of previous estimates 162 327 217 Extensions, discoveries and other additions 2 3 2 Production (153) (159) (179) Balance, Proved Reserves as of December 31, 2022 2,967 2,740 3,424 Revisions of previous estimates (1,235) (572) (1,330) Extensions, discoveries and other additions 164 9 165 Production (318) (388) (382) Balance, Proved Reserves as of December 31, 2023 1,578 1,789 1,877 Proved developed reserves: December 31, 2021 1,659 1,907 1,977 December 31, 2022 1,838 2,118 2,191 December 31, 2023 1,489 1,789 1,788 Proved undeveloped reserves: December 31, 2021 1,296 662 1,407 December 31, 2022 1,129 622 1,233 December 31, 2023 89 0 89 Extensions and discoveries. During the year ended December 31, 2023, 4 gross wells (0.3 net) were drilled in the Permian Platform area. Extensions and discoveries included 165 MBoe of proved developed and undeveloped reserves that were a result of drilling and waterflood activity. During the year ended December 31, 2022, 6 gross wells (0.5 net) were drilled in the Permian Platform area. Extensions and discoveries included 2.4 MBoe of proved developed and undeveloped reserves that were a result of 2022 drilling activity. During the year ended December 31, 2021, 5 gross wells (0.42 net) were drilled in the Permian Platform area and 1 gross well (0.13 net) was drilled in the Permian Shelf area. Extensions and discoveries included 29 MBoe of proved developed and undeveloped reserves that were a result of 2021 drilling activity in the Permian Platform and Permian Shelf areas by working interest partners. 51 Revisions of previous estimates. During the year ended December 31, 2023, revisions of previous estimates decreased proved reserves by 39%, primarily due to the removal of certain proved undeveloped reserves due to the SEC five-year booking rule, and also due to negative price revisions related to lower oil and natural gas prices. The annual average WTI Cushing and Henry Hub spot oil and natural gas price of $78.22 per Bbl and $2.64 per MMbtu used to determine reserves as of December 31, 2023, was 17% and 59% lower than the $93.67 per Bbl and $6.36 per MMbtu used to determine reserves as of December 31, 2022, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, revisions of previous estimates increased oil reserves by 6%, primarily due to an increase in the average oil price used to estimate future net reserves. The annual average WTI Cushing spot oil price of $93.67 per Bbl used to determine reserves as of December 31, 2022, was 29% higher than the $66.56 per Bbl used to determine reserves as of December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, revisions of previous estimates increased oil reserves by 25%, primarily due to an increase in the average oil price used to estimate future net reserves. The annual average WTI Cushing spot oil price of $66.56 per Bbl used to determine reserves as of December 31, 2021, was 67% higher than the $39.57 per Bbl used to determine reserves as of December 31, 2020. Production. During the year ended December 31, 2023, production decreased oil reserves by 382 MBoe. During the year ended December 31, 2022, production decreased oil reserves by 179 MBoe. During the year ended December 31, 2021, production decreased oil reserves by 172 MBoe. Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows The following is a summary of a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows related to the Trust\u2019s Net Profits Interest in total proved natural gas and oil reserve quantities. Information presented is based upon valuation of proved reserves by using discounted cash flows based upon average oil and gas prices during the 12-month period prior to the fiscal year-end, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions and severance and ad valorem taxes, if any, and economic conditions, discounted at the required rate of 10%. As the Trust is not subject to taxation at the Trust level, no provision for income taxes has been made in the following disclosure. Trust prices may differ from posted NYMEX prices due to differences in product quality and property location. The impact of changes in current prices on reserves could vary significantly from year to year. Accordingly, the information presented below should not be viewed as an estimate of the fair market value of the Trust\u2019s oil and natural gas reserves or the costs that would be incurred to acquire equivalent reserves. A market value determination would require the analysis of additional parameters. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves attributable to the Trust was as follows as of the dates indicated (in thousands): December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Future costs $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 Future net cash flows 124,680 292,000 203,158 Discount of future net cash flows at 10% (59,643 ) (146,982 ) (97,545 ) Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows $ 65,037 $ 145,018 $ 105,613 Estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves are by their nature imprecise. Estimates of future net revenue attributable to proved reserves are sensitive to the unpredictable prices of oil and natural gas and other variables. Accordingly, under the allocation method used to derive the Trust\u2019s quantity of proved reserves, changes in prices will result in changes in quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and estimated future net revenues. 52 The changes in standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and natural gas reserves attributable to the Trust for the periods indicated (in thousands): Total 2023 2022 2021 Balance at the beginning of the period (1) $ 145,018 $ 105,613 $ 53,866 Net change in prices and production costs (34,008 ) 45,420 42,128 Net change in future development costs 0 0 0 Sales of oil and natural gas, net of production costs (14,241 ) (15,779 ) (9,556 ) Extensions and discoveries 5,801 165 1,160 Purchase of reserves 0 0 0 Divestiture of reserves 0 0 0 Revisions of previous quantity estimates (51,231 ) 11,597 13,301 Previously estimated development costs incurred 0 0 0 Net change in income taxes 0 0 0 Accretion of discount 14,502 10,561 5,387 Changes in timing and other (804 ) (12,559 ) (673 ) Balance at the end of the period (1) $ 65,037 $ 145,018 $ 105,613 (1) Balance is as of December 31 of the previous year. For 2023, $2.637 per MMBtu of natural gas and $78.22 per Bbl of oil were used in determining future net revenue. These prices were based on a 12-month unweighted average of the first-day-of-the-month pricing of Henry Hub natural gas and WTI oil. For 2022, $6.358 per MMBtu of natural gas and $93.67 per Bbl of oil were used in determining future net revenue. These prices were based on a 12-month unweighted average of the first-day-of-the-month pricing of Henry Hub natural gas and WTI oil. For 2021, $3.598 per MMBtu of natural gas and $66.56 per Bbl of oil were used in determining future net revenue. These prices were based on a 12-month unweighted average of the first-day-of-the-month pricing of Henry Hub natural gas and WTI oil. 12.
