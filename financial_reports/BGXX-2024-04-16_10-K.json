In February 2024, we received approval from the New Mexico Board of Pharmacy to produce additional Schedule I and Schedule II controlled substances at our Grants, NM facility (NM Board of Pharmacy License Nos. CS02324187 and WD20220144). We have applied for an additional DEA Bulk Manufacturing Registration for these additional Schedule I and Schedule II controlled substances. Our decision to expand beyond cannabis to other plant-based medicines is in response to increased demand for additional controlled substances, the growing need to bolster domestic supply and production of plant based medicines, and the DEA\u2019s recent decision to increase quotas for certain psychedelic controlled substances. Psilocybin, in particular, has received significant media attention in recent years, and clinical trials on the drug\u2019s potential are underway at the Johns Hopkins Center for Psychedelic & Consciousness Research, the University of California, New York University, the University of Michigan, Yale University, and the Usona Institute, among others. Additionally, in July 2023, the American Medical Association (\u201cAMA\u201d) published language for new Current Procedural Terminology (\u201cCPT\u201d) III codes for psychedelic therapies. The codes went into effect on January 1, 2024. These new CPT codes will facilitate reimbursement and access to FDA-approved psychedelic therapies in the U.S. While no psychedelic-assisted therapy has yet been approved by the FDA, several potential new drugs are in various phases of clinical trials with the potential for at least one approval in 2024. The additional DEA Bulk Manufacturing Registration that Bright Green is seeking will allow us to supply the growing demand for psychedelic and plant-based medicine research, as well as to produce Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (\u201cAPIs\u201d) for a number of key pharmaceutical drugs. Given the recent prescription drug shortages experienced both in the U.S. and in other countries, our additional approval would allow us to meet U.S. demand for these drugs and contribute a consistent domestic supply of these drugs both for API and for research purposes.",

The DEA recently issued a call for more cannabis research supply based on the increased demand for cannabis research in the U.S. As described herein, on April 28, 2023, we received the DEA Registration, which allows us to produce federally legal cannabis, cannabis extracts, and tetrahydrocannabinol and to sell legally within the U.S. to licensed researchers and pharmaceutical companies, in addition to qualifying us to export cannabis internationally. In January 2024, the DEA increased its quotas not only for cannabis but also for psilocybin and other psychedelics to meet medical and scientific needs.

Twenty-two of those states and the District of Columbia and Northern Mariana have also legalized cannabis for adults for non-medical purposes (sometimes referred to as adult use). Under U.S. federal law, however, those activities are illegal. Cannabis, other than hemp (defined by the U.S. government as Cannabis sativa L. with a THC concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis), is a Schedule I controlled substance under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq.) (the \u201cCSA\u201d). Even in states or territories that have legalized cannabis to some extent, the cultivation, possession, and sale of cannabis in-state or where those activities are deemed involved in interstate commerce, all violate the CSA and are punishable by imprisonment, substantial fines and forfeiture. Moreover, individuals and entities may violate federal law if they aid and abet another in violating the CSA, or conspire with another to violate the law, and violating the CSA is a predicate for certain other crimes, including money laundering laws and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the federal government has the authority to regulate and criminalize the sale, possession and use of cannabis, even for individual medical purposes, regardless of whether it is legal under state law.",

In 2018, then U.S. Attorney General Jefferson Sessions rescinded the DOJ\u2019s previous guidance (the Cole Memo, dated August 29, 2013) that had given federal prosecutors discretion not to enforce federal law in states that legalized cannabis, as long as the state\u2019s legal regime adequately addressed specified federal priorities. The Sessions memo stated that each U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office should follow established principles that govern all federal prosecutions when deciding which cannabis activities to prosecute. Since the Sessions memo was issued nearly five years ago, U.S. Attorneys have not targeted state law compliant entities. The policy of not prosecuting companies complying with state cannabis laws is likely to continue under current U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland. In April 2022, Attorney General Garland reiterated that prosecuting the possession of cannabis is \u201cnot an efficient use\u201d of federal resources, especially \u201cgiven the ongoing opioid and methamphetamine epidemic[s]\u201d facing the nation. Recent statements made by Garland suggest that the DOJ may issue further guidance on cannabis enforcement, though the timing of such guidance remains unknown. In March 2023, Garland testified in a Congressional hearing that the DOJ was continuing its work on a new memorandum regarding cannabis enforcement. He stated that the policy will be \u201cvery close to what was done in the Cole memorandum\u201d but was yet to be finalized. While these statements are not promises to avoid federal interference with state cannabis laws, and do not amount to desuetude, it does signal that the enforcement priorities of DOJ lie elsewhere. Notwithstanding the comments made by the Attorney General, there is no guarantee that the current presidential administration will not change its stated policy regarding the low-priority enforcement of U.S. federal cannabis laws that conflict with state laws. The current administration could reverse course and decide to enforce U.S. federal cannabis laws vigorously, or a future administration could do so.",

However, the court noted that, if the spending bill provision were not continued, prosecutors could enforce against conduct occurring during the statute of limitations even while the provision was previously in force. Other courts that have considered the issue have ruled similarly. This affords some extra protection for medical cannabis businesses, but does not apply to adult use businesses.

Nancy Mace (R-SC) filed the States Reform Act, which would repeal the federal prohibition of and further regulate cannabis on the federal level. This session has seen additional incremental reform bills, including a bill that would direct the Attorney General of the United States to amend the CSA to move cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Act (the \u201cMarijuana 1 to 3 Act\u201d), and a bill to allow medical cannabis patients to purchase and possess firearms (the \u201cSecond Amendment Protection Act\u201d).

If the DEA chooses to reschedule cannabis pursuant to the HHS recommendation, the full implications are currently unknown. The DEA\u2019s decision to reclassify cannabis would neither legalize nor likely eliminate current state cannabis programs. Under schedule III, cannabis would remain a controlled substance and state-legal programs would continue to operate outside of federally legal channels particularly because no state operator currently holds a DEA registration to manufacture or dispense cannabis. Additionally, states (and potentially federal agencies) may take rescheduling of cannabis as an opportunity to update their laws in manners that are favorable or unfavorable to us.

By 2025, 5.4 million Americans, or 2.4% of U.S. adults, are predicted to be registered patients in medical cannabis states, according to a report by New Frontier Data (\u201cNew Frontier\u201d). New Frontier also projects that the medical cannabis market will nearly double to over $16 billion in that time, taking into account more geographies within the U.S. legalizing cannabis, which will lead to market expansion, the normalization of cannabis which will increase the number of consumers, and medical cannabis patients turning to cannabis as an alternative to prescription drugs. The global medical cannabis market is projected to reach $87.4 billion by 2027, according to Global Market Insights (\u201cGMI\u201d). The DEA\u2019s aggregate production quotas for cannabis are 6,675 kg in 2024 for dried flower (an estimated $73 million market) and 1,000 kg for cannabis extract (an estimated $100 million market). These aggregate production quotas are expected to continue increasing to meet increasing demand for cannabis research in the U.S. In addition to government funding, some institutions are already receiving private investment in cannabis research. For example, Harvard and MIT received a $9 million donation to fund research into cannabis\u2019 influence on brain health and behavior. Additionally, CB2 insights has noted that average prescriptions for qualifying conditions such as chronic pain, PTSD, sleep disorders, epilepsy and anxiety saw a decline in 11% in favor of medical cannabis replacement leading the analysts to estimate that more than $4 billion in sales that currently go to pharmaceutical products could be redirected towards medical cannabis. Further research on cannabis legalization and its impact on public health are needed and are likely to take place over the coming years, as the DEA has recognized the increased need for cannabis related research.

Illicit market participants divert customers away through product offering, price point, anonymity and convenience. Outdoor cultivation also significantly reduces the barrier to entry by reducing the start-up capital required for new entrants in the cannabis industry. It may also ultimately lower prices as capital expenditure requirements related to growing outside are typically much lower than those associated with indoor growing. Further, the licensed outdoor cultivation capacity is extremely large.

In the absence of an active public trading market, investors may not be able to liquidate their investments in our shares of common stock. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling our common stock or equity-linked securities, our ability to motivate our employees through equity incentive awards and our ability to acquire other companies, products or technologies by using our common stock or equity-linked securities consideration. Further, the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be, volatile. Between May 17, 2022, the date our common stock began trading on Nasdaq, and April 11, 2024, the market price of our common stock ranged from a high of $58.00 on May 18, 2022 to a low of $0.1501 on February 13, 2024.",

In February 2024, we received approval from the New Mexico Board of Pharmacy to produce additional Schedule I and Schedule II controlled substances at our Grants, NM facility (NM Board of Pharmacy License Nos. CS02324187 and WD20220144). We have applied for an additional DEA Bulk Manufacturing Registration for these additional Schedule I and Schedule II controlled substances. Our decision to expand beyond cannabis to other plant-based medicines is in response to increased demand for additional controlled substances, the growing need to bolster domestic supply and production of plant based medicines, and the DEA\u2019s recent decision to increase quotas for certain psychedelic controlled substances. Psilocybin, in particular, has received significant media attention in recent years, and clinical trials on the drug\u2019s potential are underway at the Johns Hopkins Center for Psychedelic & Consciousness Research, the University of California, New York University, the University of Michigan, Yale University, and the Usona Institute, among others. Additionally, in July 2023, the American Medical Association (\u201cAMA\u201d) published language for new Current Procedural Terminology (\u201cCPT\u201d) III codes for psychedelic therapies. The codes went into effect on January 1, 2024. These new CPT codes will facilitate reimbursement and access to FDA-approved psychedelic therapies in the U.S. While no psychedelic-assisted therapy has yet been approved by the FDA, several potential new drugs are in various phases of clinical trials with the potential for at least one approval in 2024. The additional DEA Bulk Manufacturing Registration that Bright Green is seeking will allow us to supply the growing demand for psychedelic and plant-based medicine research, as well as to produce Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (\u201cAPIs\u201d) for a number of key pharmaceutical drugs. Given the recent prescription drug shortages experienced both in the U.S. and in other countries, our additional approval would allow us to meet U.S. demand for these drugs and contribute a consistent domestic supply of these drugs both for API and for research purposes.",

In January 2024, the DEA increased its quotas not only for cannabis but also for psilocybin and other psychedelics to meet medical and scientific needs.

Our management subsequently concluded that a material weakness existed and our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2022. This determination was made as a result of a recording error of the fair value of shares of common stock we issued for services in June 2022. Such shares have a fair value of $8.00 per share, the price of our common stock at the time of our Direct Listing, but were initially recorded at a fair value of $4.00 per share. With this error being corrected in amendment no. 1 to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2022, net loss increased by $6,297,960. We have strengthened our review controls around the issuance of shares of common stock and the recording of the associated expense by adding an additional reviewer to the review process.

Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of activities. The new standard became effective for public business entities on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted.

Recently Issued but Not Adopted Accounting Standards In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-07 are intended to enhance disclosures for significant segment expenses for all public entities required to report segment information in accordance with ASC 280. ASC 280 requires a public entity to report for each reportable segment a measure of segment profit or loss that its chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) uses to assess segment performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. The amendments in ASU 2023-07 improve financial reporting by requiring disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis for all public entities to enable investors to develop more useful financial analyses. Currently, Topic 280 requires that a public entity disclose certain information about its reportable segments. For example, a public entity is required to report a measure of segment profit or loss that the CODM uses to assess segment performance and make decisions about allocating resources. ASC 280 also requires other specified segment items and amounts, such as depreciation, amortization, and depletion expense, to be disclosed under certain circumstances. The amendments in ASU 2023-07 do not change or remove those disclosure requirements. The amendments in ASU 2023-07 also do not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. The amendments in ASU 2023-07 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. A public entity should apply the amendments in ASU 2023-07 retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently assessing the impact this standard will have on the Company\u2019s future consolidated financial statements.",

The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity date commensurate with the expected term of the associated award.

Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, the Company is routinely defendants in, or parties to a number of pending and threatened legal actions including actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, the Company cannot state what the eventual outcome of such matters will be. Legal provisions are established when it becomes probable that the Company will incur an expense related to a legal action and the amount can be reliably estimated. Such provisions are recorded at the best estimate of the amount required to settle any obligation related to these legal actions as at the consolidated balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Management and internal and external experts are involved in estimating any amounts that may be required. The actual costs of resolving these claims may vary significantly from the amount of the legal provisions. The Company\u2019s estimate involves significant judgement, given the varying stages of the proceedings, the fact that the Company\u2019s liability, if any, has yet to be determined and the fact that the underlying matters will change from time to time. Other than as set forth below, the Company is not presently a party to any litigation. The Company is not able to make a reliable assessment of the potential losses as these matters are at an early stage, accordingly, no amounts have been accrued in the consolidated financial statements.",
