We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own or acquire shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons. However, we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in our initial business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target, or issue a substantial number of new shares to third-parties in connection with financing our initial business combination. In such cases, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired by us is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking shareholder approval, as applicable. In addition, we agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. Status as a Public Company We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our shares or for a combination of our shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us. Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters\u2019 ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders\u2019 interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company\u2019s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. We are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d).

If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following August 17, 2026, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year\u2019s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. Additionally, we are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year\u2019s second fiscal quarter, and (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year or the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year\u2019s second fiscal quarter. Financial Position With funds available for a business combination in the amount of approximately $39,500,000, after payment of $9,660,000 of deferred underwriting fees, which includes funds not held in the trust account, in each case before fees and expenses associated with our initial business combination, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt or leverage ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third-party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us. Effecting Our Initial Business Combination We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations until we complete our initial business combination. We intend to complete our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our shares, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 5",

We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity in connection with the completion of our initial business combination (which may include a specified future issuance), and we may complete our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering or loans rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by applicable law or we decide to do so for business or other reasons, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately, including pursuant to any specified future issuance, or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. Sources of Target Businesses We expect to receive proprietary transaction opportunities to originate as a result of the business relationships, direct outreach, and deal sourcing activities of our management team. In addition to the proprietary deal flow, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms, private equity groups, large business enterprises, and other market participants. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this Report and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our management team, as well as some of their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate. In no event will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder\u2019s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). We may pay such financial consulting fee in the event such party or parties provide us with specific target company, industry, financial or market expertise, as well as insights, relationships, services or resources that we believe are necessary in order to assess, negotiate and consummate an initial business combination. The amount of any such financial consulting fee we pay will be based upon the prevailing market for similar services for comparable transactions at such time, and will be subject to the review of our audit committee pursuant to the audit committee\u2019s policies and procedures relating to transactions that may present conflicts of interest. Lack of Business Diversification We may complete our initial business combination with a single target business or multiple target businesses simultaneously or within a short period of time. However, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination with more than one target business because of various factors, including the existence of complex accounting issues and the requirement that we prepare and file pro forma financial statements with the SEC that present operating results and the financial condition of several target businesses as if they had been 6",

Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, net of taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account, as of December 31, 2023, was approximately $10.81 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.

For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding ordinary shares voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. Our sponsor owns shares representing 60.3% of our outstanding ordinary shares. Accordingly, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, the necessary shareholder approval will be received, which may not be the case if our sponsor, officers and directors agreed to vote their founder shares in accordance with the majority of the votes cast by our public shareholders. We intend to give approximately 30 days (but not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days) prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our sponsor, officers and directors, make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem its public shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters\u2019 fees and commissions (so that we are do not then become subject to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination.

For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and instead may search for an alternate business combination. Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination if We Seek Shareholder Approval Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, which we refer to as the \u201cExcess Shares,\u201d without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder\u2019s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders\u2019 ability to redeem to no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association do not restrict our shareholders\u2019 ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. 11",

            "context": "Tendering Share Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights We may require our public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company\u2019s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder\u2019s option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public shareholders to satisfy such delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders\u2019 vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the Company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an \u201coption window\u201d after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the Company\u2019s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the Company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become \u201coption\u201d rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder\u2019s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved. Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or two business days prior to the date of the general meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable (unless we elect to allow additional withdrawal rights). Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination. If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 12",

Our sponsor, officers and directors have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time period. However, if our sponsor, officers or directors acquire public shares in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted time period. Our sponsor, officers, and directors agreed, pursuant to a letter agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not completed our initial business combination by August 17, 2024, or during any Extension Period, or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders\u2019 rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters\u2019 fees and commissions (so that we are do not then become subject to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business combination. We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the proceeds held outside the trust account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes on interest income earned on the trust account balance, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. 13",

The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors\u2019 claims. Although we seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest and claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party\u2019s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Marcum LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, nor will the underwriters of our initial public offering. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (except for the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us, or by a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor\u2019s only assets are securities of our Company. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per public share in connection with any redemption of your public shares.

While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely.

Competition In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business, we expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Additionally, the number of blank check companies looking for business combination targets has increased compared to recent years and many of these blank check companies are sponsored by entities or persons that have significant experience with completing business combinations. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources.

Our sponsor owns shares representing 60.3% of our outstanding ordinary shares. Accordingly, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, the necessary shareholder approval will be received, which may not be the case if our sponsor, officers and directors agreed to vote their founder shares in accordance with the majority of the votes cast by our public shareholders. Your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination will be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash unless we seek shareholder approval of the business combination. At the time of your investment in us, you will not be provided with an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any target businesses. Since our board of directors may complete a business combination without seeking shareholder approval, public shareholders may not have the right or opportunity to vote on the business combination. Accordingly, if we do not seek shareholder approval, your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to exercising your redemption rights within the period of time (which will be at least 20 business days) set forth in our tender offer documents mailed to our public shareholders in which we describe our initial business combination. The ability of our public shareholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into a business combination with a target. We may seek to enter into a business combination transaction agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights, we would not be able to meet such closing condition and, as a result, would not be able to proceed with the business combination. Furthermore, we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters\u2019 fees and commissions (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would cause us to not meet such net tangible asset condition, we would not proceed with such redemption and the related business combination and may instead search for an alternate business combination. Prospective targets will be aware of these risks and, thus, may be reluctant to enter into a business combination transaction with us. The ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure. At the time we enter into an agreement for our initial business combination, we will not know how many shareholders may exercise their redemption rights, and therefore will need to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption. If our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the trust account to meet such requirements, or arrange for third-party financing. In addition, if a larger number of shares is submitted for redemption than we initially expected, we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the trust account or arrange for third-party financing. Raising additional third-party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels.

The amount of the deferred underwriting commissions payable to the underwriters will not be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed in connection with a business combination. The per-share amount we will distribute to shareholders who properly exercise their redemption rights will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commission and after such redemptions, the per-share value of shares held by non-redeeming shareholders will reflect our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting commissions. The ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares could increase the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful and that you would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem your shares. If our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful is increased. If our initial business combination is unsuccessful, you would not receive your pro rata portion of the trust account until we liquidate the trust account.

In either situation, you may suffer a material loss on your investment or lose the benefit of funds expected in connection with our redemption until we liquidate or you are able to sell your shares in the open market. The requirement that we complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination and may limit the time we have in which to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets, in particular as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our initial business combination on terms that would produce value for our shareholders. Any potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning a business combination will be aware that we must complete our initial business combination by August 17, 2024, or during any Extension Period. Consequently, such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating a business combination, knowing that if we do not complete our initial business combination with that particular target business, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination with any target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the end of the timeframe described above.

See \u201c\u2014If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.00 per share\u201d and other risk factors in this section. If we are unable to complete an initial business combination by August 17, 2024, we may seek another amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to further extend the period of time we have to complete an initial business combination beyond that date. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association require that such an amendment be approved by a special resolution. Our search for a business combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected by geopolitical tension around the world, any other challenging global events (such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters or a significant outbreak of infectious diseases), and the status of debt and equity markets. Geopolitical tension around the world and any other challenging macroeconomic conditions or events (such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters or a significant outbreak of infectious diseases) could adversely affect the economies and financial markets worldwide, and the business of any potential target business with which we seek to consummate, or consummate, a business combination could be materially and adversely affected. If the disruptions posed by such events continue for an extensive period of time, our ability to consummate a business combination, or the operations of a target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected. In addition, our ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by events (such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters or a significant outbreak of infectious diseases), including as a result of increased market volatility, decreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may enter into certain transactions, including purchasing shares or warrants from the public, which may influence the outcome of a proposed business combination and reduce the public \u201cfloat\u201d of our securities. If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or public warrants or a combination thereof in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination, although they are under no obligation to do so. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), our initial shareholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our initial 20",

However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. The purpose of any such transaction could be to (1) vote such shares in favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the initial business combination, (2) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination or (3) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public \u201cfloat\u201d of our Class A ordinary shares or warrants and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, possibly making it difficult to obtain or maintain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. If a shareholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with our initial business combination, or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed. We will comply with the tender offer rules or proxy rules, as applicable, when conducting redemptions in connection with our initial business combination. Despite our compliance with these rules, if a shareholder fails to receive our tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, such shareholder may not become aware of the opportunity to redeem its shares. In addition, the tender offer documents or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will describe the various procedures that must be complied with in order to validly tender or redeem public shares. For example, we may require our public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically. In the event that a shareholder fails to comply with these or any other procedures, its shares may not be redeemed. Because of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share on our redemption of our public shares, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, and our warrants will expire worthless. We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Additionally, the number of blank check companies looking for business combination targets has increased compared to recent years and many of these blank check companies are sponsored by entities or persons that have significant experience with completing business combinations. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. 21",

Additionally, our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by target businesses. This may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating and completing an initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.

The funds available to us outside of the trust account may not be sufficient to allow us to operate until at least August 17, 2024, or during any Extension Period, assuming that our initial business combination is not completed during that time. We believe that the funds available to us outside of the trust account will be sufficient to allow us to operate until August 17, 2024, or during any Extension Period; however, we cannot assure you that our estimate is accurate. Of the funds available to us, we could use a portion of the funds available to us to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business. We could also use a portion of the funds as a down payment or to fund a \u201cno-shop\u201d provision (a provision in letters of intent or merger agreements designed to keep target businesses from \u201cshopping\u201d around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into a letter of intent or merger agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business and were subsequently required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise), we might not have sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conduct due diligence with respect to, a target business. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. In certain circumstances, our public shareholders may receive less than $10.00 per share upon our liquidation. If the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants not being held in the trust account are insufficient, it could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and complete our initial business combination and we will depend on loans from our sponsor or management team to fund our search for a business combination, to pay our taxes and to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to obtain these loans, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination. As of December 31, 2023, we held $1,222,918 outside the trust account to fund our working capital requirements. If we are required to seek additional capital, we would need to borrow funds from our sponsor, management team or other third parties to operate, or we may be forced to liquidate. None of our sponsor, members of our management team nor any of their affiliates is under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us in such circumstances. Any such advances may be repaid only from funds held outside the trust account or from funds released to us upon completion of our initial business combination. Up to $2,000,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $0.75 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

In certain circumstances, our public shareholders may receive less than $10.00 per share on the redemption of their shares. Changes in the market for directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and complete an initial business combination. The market for directors and officers liability insurance for special purpose acquisition companies has changed in ways adverse to us and our management team. Fewer insurance companies are offering quotes for directors and officers liability coverage, the premiums charged for such policies have generally increased and the terms of such policies have generally become less favorable. These trends may continue into the future. The increased cost and decreased availability of directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and complete an initial business combination. In order to obtain directors and officers liability insurance or modify its coverage as a result of becoming a public company, the post-business combination entity might need to incur greater expense and/or accept less favorable terms. Furthermore, any failure to obtain adequate directors and officers liability insurance could have an adverse impact on the post-business combination\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified officers and directors. In addition, after completion of any initial business combination, our directors and officers could be subject to potential liability from claims arising from conduct alleged to have occurred prior to such initial business combination. As a result, in order to protect our directors and officers, the post-business combination entity may need to purchase additional insurance with respect to any such claims (\u201crun-off insurance\u201d). The need for run-off insurance would be an added expense for the post-business combination entity and could interfere with or frustrate our ability to consummate an initial business combination on terms favorable to our investors. If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.00 per share. Our placing of funds in the trust account may not protect those funds from third-party claims against us. Although we seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if they execute such agreements they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party\u2019s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Making such a request of potential target businesses may make our acquisition proposal less attractive to them and, to the extent prospective target businesses refuse to execute such a waiver, it may limit the field of potential target businesses that we might pursue. Marcum LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, nor will the underwriters of our initial public offering. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where 23",

In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we have not completed our initial business combination within the prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders could be less than the $10.00 per share initially held in the trust account, due to claims of such creditors. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (except for the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us, or by a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor\u2019s only assets are securities of our Company. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per public share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. Our independent directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public shareholders. In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public shareholders may be reduced below $10.00 per share.

If we are required to windup, liquidate the trust account and distribute such amount therein, pro rata, to our public shareholders, as part of any liquidation process, such winding up, liquidation and distribution must comply with the applicable provisions of the Companies Act. In that case, investors may be forced to wait beyond the allotted time period before the redemption proceeds of our trust account become available to them and they receive the return of their pro rata portion of the proceeds from our trust account. We have no obligation to return funds to investors prior to the date of our redemption or liquidation unless, prior thereto, we consummate our initial business combination or amend certain provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and then only in cases where investors have properly sought to redeem their Class A ordinary shares.

Our shareholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares.

We may not hold an annual meeting of shareholders until after the consummation of our initial business combination, which could delay the opportunity for our shareholders to elect directors. In accordance with the NYSE corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual meeting until one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on the NYSE. There is no requirement under the Companies Act for us to hold annual or extraordinary general meetings to appoint directors. Until we hold an annual general meeting, public shareholders may not be afforded the opportunity to appoint directors and to discuss company affairs with management. Our board of directors is divided into three classes, each of which (except for those directors appointed prior to our first annual general meeting) will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being appointed in each year. In addition, as holders of our Class A ordinary shares, our public shareholders will not have the right to vote on the appointment of directors until after the consummation of our initial business combination. The grant of registration rights to our initial shareholders may make it more difficult to complete our initial business combination, and the future exercise of such rights may adversely affect the market price of our Class A ordinary shares. Pursuant to an agreement to be entered into on or prior to the closing of our initial public offering, our initial shareholders and their permitted transferees can demand that we register the resale of their founder shares, after those shares convert to Class A ordinary shares. In addition, holders of our private placement warrants and their permitted transferees can demand that we register the resale of the private placement warrants and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants, and holders of warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans may demand that we register the resale of such warrants or the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of such warrants. We will bear the cost of registering these securities. The registration and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A ordinary shares. In addition, the existence of the registration rights may make our initial business combination more costly or difficult to conclude. This is because the shareholders of the target business may increase the equity stake they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on the market price of our Class A ordinary shares that is expected when the ordinary shares owned by our initial shareholders, holders of our private placement warrants or holders of our working capital loans or their respective permitted transferees are registered for resale. Because we are not limited to a particular industry, sector or geographic area nor have we selected any specific target businesses with which to pursue our initial business combination, you will be unable to ascertain the merits or risks of any particular target business\u2019 operations. Although we expect to focus our search for a target business in the industrials sector, we may seek to complete a business combination with an operating company in any industry, sector or geographic area. However, we will not, under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, be permitted to complete our initial business combination solely with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations. Because we have not yet selected or approached any specific target business with respect to a business combination, there is no basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any particular target business\u2019s operations, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition or prospects. To the extent we complete our initial business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations with which we combine. For example, if we combine with a financially unstable business or an entity 28",

Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if such opportunity were available, in a business combination target. Accordingly, any shareholders or warrant holders who choose to remain a shareholder or warrant holder following our initial business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such security holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value. Members of our management team may in the future be involved in governmental investigations and civil litigation relating to the business affairs of companies with which they are, were, or may in the future be, affiliated. This may negatively affect our ability to consummate an initial business combination. During the course of their careers, members of our management team have been employed by, served as board members of, and assisted many companies going through turnarounds, as well as companies in special situations, such as financial distress, restructuring and companies suffering from mismanagement in attempts to rectify such problems. As a result of their involvement with companies in these situations, they may in the future be involved in governmental investigations and civil litigation relating to the business affairs of such companies. Any such investigations or litigations may divert our management team\u2019s attention and resources away from searching for an initial business combination, may be detrimental to our reputation, and thus may negatively affect our ability to complete an initial business combination. We may seek acquisition opportunities in industries or sectors which may or may not be outside of our management\u2019s area of expertise. We will consider a business combination outside of our management\u2019s area of expertise if a business combination candidate is presented to us and we determine that such candidate offers an attractive acquisition opportunity for our Company. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular business combination candidate, we cannot assure you that we will adequately ascertain or assess all the significant risk factors. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will not ultimately prove to be less favorable to investors in our initial public offering than a direct investment, if an opportunity were available, in a business combination candidate. In the event we elect to pursue an acquisition outside of the areas of our management\u2019s expertise, our management\u2019s expertise may not be directly applicable to its evaluation or operation, and the information contained in this Report regarding the areas of our management\u2019s expertise would not be relevant to an understanding of the business that we elect to acquire. As a result, our management may not be able to adequately ascertain or assess all the significant risk factors.

Such security holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value. Although we have identified general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses, we may enter into our initial business combination with a target that does not meet such criteria and guidelines, and as a result, the target business with which we enter into our initial business combination may not have attributes entirely consistent with our general criteria and guidelines. Although we have identified general criteria and guidelines for evaluating prospective target businesses, it is possible that a target business with which we enter into our initial business combination will not have all of these positive attributes.

In addition, if shareholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange rules, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, it may be more difficult for us to attain shareholder approval of our initial business combination if the target business does not meet our general criteria and guidelines. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. In certain circumstances, our public shareholders may receive less than $10.00 per share on the redemption of their shares. We may seek acquisition opportunities with an early stage company, a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of revenue or earnings, which could subject us to volatile revenues or earnings or difficulty in retaining key personnel. To the extent we complete our initial business combination with an early stage company, a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of revenues or earnings, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the operations of the business with which we combine. These risks include investing in a business without a proven business model and with limited historical financial data, volatile revenues or earnings and difficulties in obtaining and retaining key personnel.

We are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or from an independent accounting firm, and consequently, you may have no assurance from an independent source that the price we are paying for the business is fair to our Company from a financial point of view. Unless we complete our initial business combination with an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from an independent accounting firm that the price we are paying is fair to our Company from a financial point of view. If no opinion is obtained, our shareholders will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors, who will determine fair market value based on standards generally accepted by the financial community. Such standards used will be disclosed in our proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, related to our initial business combination. We may issue additional ordinary shares or preference shares to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial business combination. We may also issue Class A ordinary shares upon the conversion of the Class B ordinary shares at a ratio greater than one-to-one at the time of our initial business combination as a result of the anti-dilution provisions contained in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. Any such issuances would dilute the interest of our shareholders and likely present other risks. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association authorize the issuance of up to 100,000,000 Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, 10,000,000 Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, and 1,000,000 preference shares, par value $0.0001 per share.

As a result, we may be able to complete our initial business combination even though a substantial majority of our public shareholders do not agree with the transaction and have redeemed their shares or, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, have entered into privately negotiated agreements to sell their shares to our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination. In order to complete our initial business combination, we may seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or other governing instruments, including our warrant agreement, in a manner that will make it easier for us to complete our initial business combination but that our shareholders or warrant holders may not support. In order to complete a business combination, blank check companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and governing instruments, including their warrant agreements. For example, blank check companies have amended the definition of business combination, increased redemption thresholds, extended the time to consummate an initial business combination and, with respect to their warrants, amended their warrant agreements to require the warrants to be exchanged for cash and/or other securities. We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our charter or other governing instruments, including to extend the time to consummate an initial business combination, in order to complete our initial business combination. The provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that relate to our pre-business combination activity (and corresponding provisions of the agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account), other than as described herein, may be amended with the approval of holders of at least 65% of our outstanding ordinary shares, which is a lower amendment threshold than that of some other blank check companies. It may be easier for us, therefore, to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and the trust agreement to facilitate the completion of an initial business combination that some of our shareholders may not support. Some other blank check companies have a provision in their charter or memorandum and articles of association which prohibits the amendment of certain of its provisions, including those which relate to a company\u2019s pre-business combination activity, without approval by holders of a certain percentage of the Company\u2019s shareholders. In those companies, amendment of these provisions typically requires approval by holders holding between 90% and 100% of the Company\u2019s public shares. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that any of its provisions related to pre-business combination activity (including the requirement to deposit proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants into the trust account and not release such amounts except in specified circumstances, and provide redemption rights to public shareholders as described herein) may be amended if approved by a special resolution thereon adopted by the affirmative vote of at least a two-thirds (2/3) majority, and corresponding provisions of the trust agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account may be amended if approved by holders if at least 65% of our outstanding ordinary shares entitled to vote thereon; provided that amendments relating to the appointment or removal of directors prior to our initial business combination require a resolution passed by the holders of a majority of our Class B ordinary shares.

As a result, we may be able to amend the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association which will govern our pre-business combination behavior more easily than some other blank check companies, and this may increase our ability to complete our initial business combination with which you do not agree. Our shareholders may pursue remedies against us for any breach of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. Our sponsor, officers, and directors have agreed, pursuant to a letter agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not completed our initial business combination by August 17, 2024, or during any Extension Period, or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders\u2019 rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. These agreements are contained in a letter agreement that we have entered into with our sponsor, officers and directors. Our public shareholders are not parties to, or third-party beneficiaries of, these agreements and, as a result, will not have the ability to pursue remedies against our sponsor, officers or directors for any breach of these agreements. As a result, in the event of a breach, our public shareholders would need to pursue a shareholder derivative action, subject to applicable law. We may be unable to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination or to fund the operations and growth of a target business, which could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular business combination. Although we believe that the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants will be sufficient to allow us to complete our initial business combination, because we have not yet selected any prospective target business we cannot ascertain the capital requirements for any particular transaction. If the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants prove to be insufficient, either because of the size of our initial business combination, the depletion of the available net proceeds in search of a target business, the obligation to repurchase for cash a significant number of shares from shareholders who elect redemption in connection with our initial business combination or the terms of negotiated transactions to purchase shares in connection with our initial business combination, we may be required to seek additional financing or to abandon the proposed business combination. We cannot assure you that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to complete our initial business combination, we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. In addition, even if we do not need additional financing to complete our initial business combination, we may require such financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. None of our officers, directors or shareholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public shareholders may only receive approximately $10.00 per share on the liquidation of our trust account, and our warrants will expire worthless. In certain circumstances, our public shareholders may receive less than $10.00 per share on the redemption of their shares. 35",

Our initial shareholders own shares representing 60.3% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares. Accordingly, they may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a shareholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support, including amendments to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and approval of major corporate transactions. If our initial shareholders purchase any additional ordinary shares in the aftermarket or in privately negotiated transactions, this would increase their control. Factors that would be considered in making such additional purchases would include consideration of the current trading price of our Class A ordinary shares. Our sponsor also exercised the ability to extend the time we will have to consummate an initial business combination by an additional 12 months. In addition, prior to the completion of our initial business combination, only holders of the Class B ordinary shares have the right to vote on the appointment of directors and holders of a majority of the outstanding Class B ordinary shares may remove members of our board of directors for any reason. In addition, our board of directors, whose members were elected by certain of our initial shareholders, is and will be divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. We may not hold an annual meeting of shareholders to elect new directors prior to the completion of our business combination, in which case all of the current directors will continue in office until at least the completion of our initial business combination. If there is an annual meeting, as a consequence of our \u201cstaggered\u201d board of directors, only a minority of the board of directors will be considered for election and our sponsor, because of its ownership position, will be able to control the outcome. Accordingly, our initial shareholders will continue to exert control at least until the completion of our business combination. Our warrants and founder shares may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A ordinary shares and make it more difficult to complete our initial business combination. We issued warrants to purchase 20,700,000 Class A ordinary as part of the units sold in our initial public offering and, simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, we issued private placement warrants to purchase an aggregate of 11,360,000 Class A ordinary shares at $11.50 per share, as part of the private placement warrants. Our initial shareholders currently own an aggregate of 6,900,000 founder shares. The founder shares are convertible into Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment as set forth herein. In addition, if our sponsor makes any working capital loans, up to $2,000,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $0.75 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. Additionally, in connection with the sponsor exercising the right to extend the time the Company will have to consummate its business combination, we issued an additional 7,360,000 private placement warrants. To the extent we issue Class A ordinary shares to complete our initial business combination, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional Class A ordinary shares upon exercise of these warrants and conversion rights could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business. Any such issuance will increase the number of issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares and reduce the value of the Class A ordinary shares issued to complete the business combination. Therefore, our warrants and founder shares may make it more difficult to complete a business combination or increase the cost of acquiring the target business. The private placement warrants have the same terms as the warrants sold as part of the units in our initial public offering except that (i) they will not be redeemable by us, (ii) they (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of these warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by our sponsor until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination, (iii) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis and (iv) the holders thereof (including with respect to the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of these warrants) are entitled to registration rights.

Even if we conduct extensive due diligence on a target business with which we combine, we cannot assure you that this diligence will surface all material issues that may be present with a particular target business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining post-combination debt financing.

We cannot provide assurance that, upon loss of control of a target business, new management will possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business. We may structure our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own or acquire shares will own less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business. However, we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction that does not meet such criteria. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in our initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new ordinary shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target, or issue a substantial number of new shares to third-parties in connection with financing our initial business combination. In such cases, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new ordinary shares, our shareholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding ordinary shares subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority shareholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the Company\u2019s shares than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain our control of the target business.

Our sponsor and officers and directors are not prohibited from sponsoring, investing or otherwise becoming involved with, any other blank check companies, including in connection with their initial business combinations, prior to us completing our initial business combination. Our sponsor and officers and directors are, and in the future expect to become, affiliated with other entities (such as operating companies or investment vehicles) that are engaged in a similar business. Our officers and directors also may become aware of business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us and the other entities including those to which they then owe certain fiduciary or contractual duties. Accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. Any such entities may access business combination opportunities ahead of us. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to another entity prior to its presentation to us. Any other special purpose acquisition company may also have terms that are the same or different than our terms, including terms that are more favorable to its investors and/or potential target businesses. Our officers, directors, security holders and their respective affiliates may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests. We have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, officers, security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary or financial interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. In fact we may enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our sponsor, our directors or officers, although we do not intend to do so. We do not have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. Accordingly, such persons or entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours. We may engage in a business combination with one or more target businesses that have relationships with entities that may be affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors which may raise potential conflicts of interest. In light of the involvement of our sponsor, officers and directors with other entities, we may decide to acquire one or more businesses affiliated with our sponsor (or its affiliates), officers or directors or otherwise 41",

Our sponsor, officers and directors are not currently aware of any specific opportunities for us to complete our initial business combination with any entities with which they are affiliated, and there have been no substantive discussions concerning a business combination with any such entity or entities. Although we will not be specifically focusing on, or targeting, any transaction with any affiliated entities, we would pursue such a transaction if we determined that such affiliated entity met our criteria for a business combination and such transaction was approved by a majority of our disinterested directors.

Risks Relating to our Securities You will not have any rights or interests in funds from the trust account, except under certain limited circumstances. To liquidate your investment, therefore, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.

In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind in the trust account. Holders of warrants will not have any right to the proceeds held in the trust account with respect to the warrants. Accordingly, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss. The NYSE may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions. Our securities may not continue to be listed on the NYSE in the future or prior to our initial business combination. In order to continue listing our securities on the NYSE prior to our initial business combination, we must maintain certain financial, distribution and share price levels. In general, we must maintain a minimum number of holders of our securities (generally 300 public shareholders). Additionally, in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to demonstrate compliance with the NYSE\u2019s initial listing requirements, which are more rigorous than the NYSE\u2019s continued listing requirements, in order to continue to maintain the listing of our securities on the NYSE. For instance, in order for our Class A ordinary shares to be listed upon the consummation of our initial business combination, at such time, our share price would generally be required to be at least $4.00 per share, our global market capitalization would be required to be at least $200,000,000, the aggregate market value of publicly-held shares would be required to be at least $100,000,000 and we would be required to have at least 400 round lot holders. We may not be able to meet those initial listing requirements at that time. 42",

These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may only be amended by a special resolution passed by at least two-thirds (2/3) of all holders (which must include a simple majority of the holders of Class B ordinary shares). Accordingly, you may not have any say in the management of our Company prior to the consummation of an initial business combination. You will not be permitted to exercise your warrants unless we register and qualify the issuance of the underlying Class A ordinary shares or certain exemptions are available. If the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares upon exercise of the warrants is not registered, qualified or exempt from registration or qualification under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, holders of warrants will not be entitled to exercise such warrants and such warrants may have no value and expire worthless. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, we agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 20 business days, after the closing of our initial business combination, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to file, and within 60 business days following our initial business combination to have declared effective, a post-effective amendment to the registration statement of which this Report forms a part or a new registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of such shares and maintain a current prospectus relating to the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants, until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so if, for example, any facts or events arise which represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement or prospectus, the financial statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current, complete or correct or the SEC issues a stop order. If the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act, we will be required to permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis in accordance with the terms of the warrant agreement. However, no warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration is available. Notwithstanding the above, if our Class A ordinary shares are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a \u201ccovered security\u201d under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders of public warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a \u201ccashless basis\u201d in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event we so elect, we will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but we will be required to use our best efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. In no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant. If the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or qualified or exempt from registration or qualification, the holder of such warrant shall not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of units will have paid the full unit purchase price solely for the Class A ordinary shares included in the units. There may be a circumstance where an exemption from registration exists for holders of our private placement warrants to exercise their warrants while a corresponding exemption does not exist for holders of the public warrants included as part of units sold in our initial public offering. In such an instance, our sponsor and its permitted transferees (which may include our directors and officers) would be able to exercise their warrants and sell the ordinary shares underlying their warrants while holders of our public warrants would not be able to exercise their warrants and sell the underlying ordinary shares. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying Class A ordinary shares for sale under all applicable state securities laws.

As a result, the exercise price of your warrants could be increased, the exercise period could be shortened and the number of Class A ordinary shares purchasable upon exercise of a warrant could be decreased, all without your approval. Our warrants were issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of public warrants and, solely with respect to any amendment to the terms of the private placement warrants or working capital warrants or any provision of the warrant agreement with respect to the private placement warrants or working capital warrants, 50% of the number of the then outstanding private placement warrants or working capital warrants, as applicable. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the public warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the public warrants with the consent of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, convert the warrants into cash or shares, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of Class A ordinary shares purchasable upon exercise of a warrant. We may redeem unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless. We have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sales price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders and provided certain other conditions are met. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, we may redeem the public warrants as set forth above even if the holders are otherwise unable to exercise the warrants. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you (i) to exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) to sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, we expect would be substantially less than the market value of your warrants. None of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us. Because each unit contains three-fourths of one redeemable warrant and only a whole warrant may be exercised, the units may be worth less than units of other blank check companies. Each unit contains three-fourths of one warrant. Because, pursuant to the warrant agreement, the warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares, only a whole warrant may be exercised at any given time. This is different from other offerings similar to ours whose units include one ordinary share and one whole warrant or a greater fraction of one whole warrant to purchase one whole share. We have established the components of the units in this way in order to reduce the dilutive effect of the warrants upon completion of a business combination since the warrants will be exercisable in the aggregate for three fourths of the number of shares compared to units that each contain one whole warrant or a greater fraction of one whole warrant to purchase one whole share, thus making us, we believe, a more attractive business combination partner for target businesses. Nevertheless, this unit structure may cause our units to be worth less than if they included one whole warrant or a greater fraction of one whole warrant to purchase one whole share. 45",

Our warrant agreement provided that, subject to applicable law, (i) any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the warrant agreement, including under the Securities Act, will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and (ii) that we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim. We have waived any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and that such courts represent an inconvenient forum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, these provisions of the warrant agreement will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our warrants shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions in our warrant agreement. If any action, the subject matter of which is within the scope the forum provisions of the warrant agreement, is filed in a court other than a court of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (a \u201cNY foreign action\u201d) in the name of any holder of our warrants, such holder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of New York in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (a \u201cNY enforcement action\u201d), and (y) having service of process made upon such warrant holder in any such NY enforcement action by service upon such warrant holder\u2019s counsel in the NY foreign action as agent for such warrant holder. This choice-of-forum provision may limit a warrant holder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with our Company, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our warrant agreement inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors. Our public and private warrants are accounted for as derivative liabilities and are recorded at fair value upon issuance with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A ordinary shares or may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination. We have issued 20,700,000 public warrants as part of the units in our initial public offering. We have also issued, simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, 11,360,000 private placement warrants and, in connection with our sponsor exercising its option to extend the period of time we will have to complete an initial business combination, an additional 7,360,000 private placement warrants. We account for the warrants underlying the units issued in our initial public offering as a warrant liability. At each reporting period (1) the accounting treatment of the warrants will be re-evaluated for proper accounting treatment as a liability or equity and (2) the fair value of the liability of the public warrants will be remeasured and the change in the fair value of the liability will be recorded as other income (expense) in our income statement. The impact of changes in fair value on earnings may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A ordinary shares. In addition, potential targets may seek a special purpose acquisition company (\u201cSPAC\u201d) that does not have warrants that are accounted for as a liability, which may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination with a target business. 46",

We are an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon our directors or officers, or enforce judgments obtained in the United States courts against our directors or officers. Our corporate affairs are governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, the Companies Act (as the same may be supplemented or amended from time to time) and the common law of the Cayman Islands. We are also subject to the federal securities laws of the United States. The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority, but are not binding on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are different from what they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws as compared to the United States, and certain states, such as Delaware, may have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholders derivative action in a federal court of the United States. We have been advised that the courts of the Cayman Islands are unlikely (i) to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state; and (ii) in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, to impose liabilities against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state, so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions are penal in nature. In those circumstances, although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated sum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the same matter, impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, or be of a kind the enforcement of which is, contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to public policy). A Cayman Islands court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. As a result of all of the above, public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by management, members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a United States company. Provisions in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our Class A ordinary shares and could entrench management. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that shareholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include a staggered board of directors, the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preference shares and the fact that prior to the completion of our initial business combination only 47",

Risks Relating to Acquiring and Operating a Business in Foreign Countries Our initial business combination or reincorporation may result in taxes imposed on shareholders or warrant holders. We may, subject to requisite shareholder approval under the Companies Act, effect a business combination with a target company in another jurisdiction, reincorporate in the jurisdiction in which the target company or business is located or in another jurisdiction. The transaction may require a shareholder or warrant holder to recognize taxable income or otherwise subject it to adverse tax consequences in the jurisdiction in which the shareholder or warrant holder is a tax resident or in which its members are resident if it is a tax transparent entity. We do not intend to make any cash distributions to shareholders or warrant holders to pay such taxes. Shareholders may be subject to withholding taxes, other taxes or other adverse tax consequences with respect to their ownership of us after the reincorporation. We may be a passive foreign investment company (\u201cPFIC\u201d), which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. investors. If we are a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S. holder of our Class A ordinary shares or warrants, the U.S. holder may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences and may be subject to additional reporting requirements. Our PFIC status for our current and subsequent taxable years may depend on whether we qualify for the PFIC start-up exception. Depending on the particular circumstances the application of the start-up exception may be subject to uncertainty, and there cannot be any assurance that we will qualify for the start-up exception. Accordingly, there can be no assurances with respect to our status as a PFIC for our current taxable year or any subsequent taxable year. Our actual PFIC status for any taxable year, moreover, will not be determinable until after the end of such taxable year. If we determine we are a PFIC for any taxable year, upon written request, we will endeavor to provide to a U.S. holder such information as the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) may require, including a PFIC Annual Information Statement, in order to enable the U.S. holder to make and maintain a \u201cqualified electing fund\u201d election. However, there is no assurance that we will timely provide such required information or that we will continue to endeavor to provide such information following an initial business combination. Such election would be unavailable with respect to our warrants in all cases. We urge U.S. investors to consult their tax advisors regarding the possible application of the PFIC rules. If we effect our initial business combination with a company located outside of the United States, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may adversely affect us. If we pursue a target company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States for our initial business combination, we may face additional burdens in connection with investigating, agreeing to and completing such initial business combination, and if we effect such initial business combination, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations. 48",

The economic, political and legal policies, developments and conditions, as well as government policies, of the country in which our operations are located could affect our business. Economic growth could be uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy and such growth may not be sustained in the future. If in the future such country\u2019s economy experiences a downturn or grows at a slower rate than expected, there may be less demand for spending in certain industries.

Exchange rate fluctuations and currency policies may cause a target business\u2019 ability to succeed in the international markets to be diminished. In the event we acquire a non-U.S. target, all revenues and income would likely be received in a foreign currency, and the dollar equivalent of our net assets and distributions, if any, could be adversely affected by reductions in the value of the local currency. The value of the currencies in our target regions fluctuate and are affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions. Any change in the relative value of such currency against our reporting currency may affect the attractiveness of any target business or, following consummation of our initial business combination, our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if a currency appreciates in value against the dollar prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, the cost of a target business as measured in dollars will increase, which may make it less likely that we are able to consummate such transaction.

We are a company with no operating results. Because we lack an operating history, you have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective of completing our initial business combination with one or more target businesses. We have no plans, arrangements or understandings with any prospective target business concerning a business combination and may be unable to complete our initial business combination. If we fail to complete our initial business combination, we will never generate any operating revenues. Past performance by our management team and their respective affiliates may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us. Information regarding performance by, or businesses associated with our management team and their respective affiliates, including Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp. (\u201cKensington SPAC I\u201d), Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp. II (\u201cKensington SPAC II\u201d) and Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp. IV (\u201cKensington SPAC IV\u201d), is presented for informational purposes only. Past performance by our management team and their respective affiliates, including with respect to Kensington SPAC I, Kensington SPAC II and Kensington SPAC IV is not a guarantee either (i) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or (ii) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of our management team\u2019s and their respective affiliates\u2019 performance, including with respect to Kensington SPAC I, Kensington SPAC II and Kensington SPAC IV, as indicative of our future performance of an investment in us or the returns we will, or are likely to, generate going forward. In addition, an investment in us is not an investment in any other entities affiliated with our management team. Furthermore, our sponsor was formed for the sole purpose of holding securities of our Company with no operational or historical record. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any business in which members of our management team were previously, are now or in the future become, affiliated or otherwise associated with are subject to events that detrimentally impact its reputation or results of operations or otherwise do not perform as expected, such events, results or performance may be detrimental to our representation and thus may negatively affect our ability to complete an initial business combination. We are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies. We are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our shareholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of any second quarter of a fiscal year, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the end of such fiscal year. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile. 51",

Overview We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on March 19, 2021. We were incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the \u201cBusiness Combination\u201d). As of December 31, 2023, we had not yet commenced operations. All activity for the period from March 19, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2023 relates to our formation and the initial public offering (the \u201cInitial Public Offering\u201d), which is described below, and since the Initial Public Offering, our activity has been limited to the search for a prospective initial Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. Our sponsor is Kensington Capital Sponsor V LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the \u201cSponsor\u201d). The registration statement for our Initial Public Offering was declared effective on August 12, 2021. On August 17, 2021, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 27,600,000 units (the \u201cUnits\u201d and, with respect to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units being offered, the \u201cPublic Shares\u201d), which included the exercise in full of the underwriters\u2019 option to purchase 3,600,000 Units, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $276.0 million, and incurring offering costs of approximately $15.7 million, of which approximately $9.7 million and approximately $889,000 was for deferred underwriting commissions and offering costs allocated to derivate warrant liabilities, respectively. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the private placement (the \u201cInitial Private Placement\u201d and together with the Additional Private Placements (as defined below), the \u201cPrivate Placements\u201d) of 11,360,000 warrants (each, a \u201cPrivate Placement Warrant\u201d and collectively with the Additional Private Placement Warrants (as defined below), the \u201cPrivate Placement Warrants\u201d) at a price of $0.75 per Private Placement Warrant to our Sponsor, generating proceeds of approximately $8.5 million. Upon closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Initial Private Placement, $276.0 million ($10.00 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and of the Private Placement Warrants in the Initial Private Placement were placed in a trust account (the \u201cTrust Account\u201d) located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and invested only in U.S. \u201cgovernment securities,\u201d within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 55",

On each of August 4, 2022 and February 15, 2023, in connection with the Extensions as described below, we consummated a private placement (each, an \u201cAdditional Private Placement\u201d and collectively, the \u201cAdditional Private Placements\u201d) of 3,680,000 warrants (each, an \u201cAdditional Private Placement Warrant\u201d and collectively, the \u201cAdditional Private Placement Warrants\u201d) at a price of $0.75 per Additional Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds in aggregate of $5,520,000. The Additional Private Placement Warrants were purchased by the Sponsor and are substantially similar to the Private Placement Warrants issued to the Sponsor at the time of the Initial Public Offering. The Additional Private Placement Warrants were issued pursuant to, and are governed by, the Warrant Agreement that we entered into at the time of the Initial Public Offering. Upon closing of the Additional Private Placements, the proceeds received by us in connection with the issuance of the Additional Private Placement Warrants were deposited in the Trust Account. On August 11, 2023 and August 14, 2023, the Sponsor and the Company entered into agreements (the \u201cNon-Redemption Agreements\u201d) with several unaffiliated third parties in exchange for them agreeing not to redeem an aggregate of 2,600,000 Class A ordinary shares (the \u201cNon-Redeemed Shares\u201d) of the Company at the extraordinary general meeting called by the Company (the \u201cExtraordinary General Meeting\u201d) to approve, among other proposals, an extension of time for the Company to consummate an initial business combination from August 17, 2023 to August 17, 2024 (the \u201cExtension\u201d). In exchange for the foregoing commitment not to redeem such shares, the Sponsor has agreed to transfer to such investors an aggregate of 568,750 Class B ordinary shares of the Company held by the Sponsor immediately following the consummation of an initial business combination if they continue to hold such Non-Redeemed Shares through the Extraordinary General Meeting. The extension to consummate a business combination from August 17, 2023 to August 17, 2024 was approved by the Company\u2019s shareholders on August 15, 2023 and the investors subject to the Non-Redemption Agreements did not redeem their shares. The Company estimated the aggregate fair value of the Sponsor shares attributable to the Non-Redemption Agreements to be $0.6 million or $0.97 per share. In connection with the Extraordinary General Meeting, holders of 23,057,267 Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.67 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $246.0 million. The terms of the Non-Redemption Agreements are further described in the Company\u2019s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 14, 2023. The foregoing description of the Non-Redemption Agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form thereof, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.12 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated herein by reference. Our management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of its Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. We initially had 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to consummate the initial Business Combination. However, we were able, by resolution of our board of directors at the option of our Sponsor, to extend the period of time we had to consummate an initial Business Combination up to two times, each by an additional 6 months (for a total of up to an additional 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering), subject to our Sponsor purchasing additional Private Placement Warrants. Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (the \u201cMemorandum and Articles\u201d), in order to extend the period of time to consummate an initial Business Combination in such a manner, our Sponsor was required to purchase an additional 3,680,000 Private Placement Warrants, at a price of $0.75 per warrant, and deposit $0.10 per each Unit (for an aggregate of approximately $2.8 million), in proceeds into the Trust Account on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for each 6-month extension. On August 4, 2022 and February 15, 2023, we elected to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a business 56",

Termination of Business Combination Agreement On April 6, 2023, we entered into a business combination agreement (the \u201cBusiness Combination Agreement\u201d) with Arrival, a joint stock company (soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme) governed by the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, having its registered office at 60A, rue des Bruy\u00e8res, L-1274 Howald, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and registered with the RCS under number B248209 (\u201cArrival\u201d). Effective as of July 3, 2023 and in accordance with Section 9.01(a) of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company and Arrival mutually agreed to terminate the Business Combination Agreement, pursuant to a letter agreement between Arrival and the Company (the \u201cTermination Letter\u201d). Under the Termination Letter, the Company waived and released all claims or causes of action against Arrival and its Non-Party Affiliates (as defined in the Termination Letter), and Arrival waived and released all claims or causes of action against the Company and its Non-Party Affiliates, that have been or could have been, could now be, or could in the future be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to the Business Combination Agreement or any other Transaction Document (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement), or the negotiation, execution, or performance or non-performance of the Business Combination Agreement or any other Transaction Document (including any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to, the Business Combination Agreement or any other Transaction Document).

Liquidity and Going Concern As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $1.2 million in our operating bank account and a working capital deficit of approximately $2.0 million. Our liquidity needs prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering were satisfied through the payment of $25,000 from our Sponsor to cover for certain expenses on behalf of us in exchange for issuance of Founder Shares (as defined in Note 4 to Financial Statements), and the loan from the Sponsor of approximately $150,000 under the Note (as defined in Note 4 to Financial Statements), which was converted into a Working Capital Loan (as defined in Note 4 to Financial Statements) on August 17, 2021. Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, our liquidity needs have been satisfied through the net proceeds from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the Initial Private Placement held outside of the Trust Account. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide us Working Capital Loans (see Note 4 to Financial Statements). As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was $150,000 outstanding under the Working Capital Loan. 57",

The Second Note is noninterest bearing and payable on the earliest of: (i) the consummation of the Company\u2019s initial business combination unless converted into working capital warrants at the option of the Sponsor, at a price of $0.75 per warrant, as described in the registration statement that the Company filed in connection with the initial public offering of its securities, (ii) August 17, 2024, and (iii) the liquidation of the Company. Such working capital warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to the Sponsor in a private placement in connection with the Company\u2019s initial public offering. The Company drew down $950,250 of the Second Note on August 29, 2023. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the fair value of the Second Note was $950,250 and $0, respectively. The terms of the Second Note are further described in the Company\u2019s Current Report on Form 8- K filed with the SEC on August 29, 2023. The foregoing description of the Second Note is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text thereof, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.13 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated herein by reference. Based upon the analysis above, management has determined that the Company does not have sufficient liquidity to meet its anticipated obligations for at least twelve months after the financial statements are issued, as such, the events and circumstances raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. In connection with our assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with the ASC 205-40, the Company has until August 17, 2024 to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time. If a Business Combination is not consummated by this date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. Management has determined that the liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Risks and Uncertainties The continuing military conflict between the Russian Federation and Ukraine, the military action between Hamas and Israel, and the risk of escalations of other military conflicts have created and are expected to create global economic consequences. The impact of these actions and related sanctions on the world economy are not determinable as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The specific impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is also not determinable as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Results of Operations Our entire activity from March 19, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2023 was in preparation for the Initial Public Offering, and since our Initial Public Offering, our activity has been limited to the search for a prospective initial Business Combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until the closing and completion of our initial Business Combination. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we had a net income of approximately $9.5 million, which consisted of a non-cash gain of approximately $2.7 million for the change in fair value of derivative warrant liabilities and approximately $9.4 million of income from investments held in the Trust Account, partly offset by approximately $2.5 million in general and administrative expenses, and $120,000 in administrative expenses-related party. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had a net income of approximately $29.2 million, which consisted of a non-cash gain of approximately $26.3 million for the change in fair value of derivative warrant liabilities, $50,000 in change in fair value of Working Capital Loan-related party and approximately $4.2 million of income from investments held in the Trust Account, partly offset by approximately $1.1 million in general and administrative expenses, and $240,000 in administrative expenses-related party. 58",

These holders are entitled to certain demand and \u201cpiggyback\u201d registration rights. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Underwriting Agreement We granted the underwriters a 45-day option from the date of the final prospectus relating to the Initial Public Offering to purchase up to 3,600,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the Initial Public Offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions. The underwriters fully exercised the over-allotment on August 17, 2021. The underwriters were entitled to an underwriting discount of $0.20 per unit, or approximately $5.5 million in the aggregate, paid upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering. $0.35 per unit, or approximately $9.7 million in the aggregate will be payable to the underwriters for deferred underwriting commissions. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. Contingent Fee Arrangement On August 3, 2023, the Company entered into an arrangement with J.V.B Financial Group, acting through its Cohen & Company Capital Markets division (\u201cCCM\u201d) to obtain capital market advisory services and to act as the Company\u2019s placement agent in connection with raising capital with a specific target in its search for a Business Combination with an unaffiliated third party (\u201cTarget\u201d). CCM would be entitled to an advisor fee of $2.0 million and a transaction fee of an amount equal to 5% of the sum of the gross proceeds raised from investors and received by the Company and Target plus proceeds released from the Trust Account without restriction with respect to any of the Class A ordinary shares that did not redeem such shares in connection with the Extension or the Business Combination (\u201cArrangement\u201d). The Company may pay CCM a discretionary fee of $1.0 million if the Company determines in its sole discretion that the performance of CCM warrants such additional fee. Per the Arrangement, the fees for these services are contingent upon the closing of a Business Combination and therefore not included as liabilities on the accompanying balance sheets. Under the Arrangement, the Company will also reimburse CCM for reasonable expenses. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, no expenses have been claimed. Service and Administrative Fees On August 12, 2021, we entered into an agreement with DEHC LLC, an affiliate the Company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, pursuant to which we agreed to pay for service and administrative fees of $20,000 per month for 18 months (or until February 12, 2023). On August 29, 2023, the agreement was amended to extend the services for the period from August 17, 2023 to August 17, 2024 with the same monthly payment. For the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 we incurred $120,000 and $240,000 for such expenses, respectively, included as general and administrative expenses-related party on the statements of operations contained herein. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had paid in full for such services.

            "context": "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates This management\u2019s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to fair value of financial instruments and accrued expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the following as our critical accounting policies: Derivative Financial Instruments We evaluate our financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives in accordance with ASC Topic 815, \u201cDerivatives and Hedging.\u201d For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value on the grant date and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. The determination of the fair value of the warrant liabilities may be subject to change as more current information becomes available and accordingly the actual results could differ significantly. Derivative warrant liabilities are classified as non-current liabilities as their liquidation is not reasonably expected to require the use of current assets or require the creation of current liabilities. Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption The Company accounts for its Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480. Class A ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Class A ordinary shares (including Class A ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company\u2019s control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Class A ordinary shares are classified as shareholders\u2019 equity. The Company\u2019s Class A ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company\u2019s control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, 4,542,733 and 27,600,000 Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders\u2019 deficit section of the Company\u2019s condensed balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of the Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. This method would view the end of the reporting period as if it were also the redemption date for the security. Effective with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company recognized the remeasurement from initial book value to redemption amount, which resulted in charges against additional paid-in capital (to the extent available) and accumulated deficit. Offering Costs Associated with Initial Public Offering Offering costs consisted of legal, accounting, underwriting fees and other costs incurred through the Initial Public Offering that were directly related to the Initial Public Offering. Offering costs were allocated to the separable financial instruments issued in the Initial Public Offering based on a relative fair value basis, compared 60",

Offering costs associated with derivative warrant liabilities were expensed as incurred and presented as non-operating expenses in the statements of operations. Offering costs associated with the Class A ordinary shares were charged against the carrying value of Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering. The Company classifies deferred underwriting commissions as non-current liabilities as their liquidation is not reasonably expected to require the use of current assets or require the creation of current liabilities. Net Income per Ordinary Share The Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, \u201cEarnings Per Share.\u201d The Company has two classes of shares, which are referred to as Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares. Income and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares. Net income per ordinary share is calculated by dividing the net income by the weighted average shares of ordinary shares outstanding for the respective period. The calculation of diluted net income does not consider the effect of the warrants underlying the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering (including the consummation of the over-allotment) and the private placement warrants to purchase an aggregate of 39,420,000 Class A ordinary shares, or the effects of the 1,467,000 shares underlying the warrants that would be issuable upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans in the calculation of diluted income per share, because their exercise is contingent upon future events and their inclusion would be anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method. The Company has considered the effect of Class B ordinary shares that were excluded from the weighted average number of basic shares outstanding as they were contingent on the exercise of over-allotment option by the underwriters. Since the contingency was satisfied, the Company has included these shares in the weighted average number as of the beginning of the period to determine the dilutive impact of these shares. Remeasurement of the redeemable Class A ordinary shares is excluded from net income per share as the redemption value approximates fair value. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, ASC Subtopic 820 \u201cFair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions\u201d. The ASU amends ASC 820 to clarify that a contractual sales restriction is not considered in measuring an equity security at fair value and to introduce new disclosure requirements for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions that are measured at fair value. The ASU applies to both holders and issuers of equity and equity-linked securities measured at fair value. The amendments in this ASU are effective for us in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for both interim and annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. We are still evaluating the impact of this pronouncement on the financial statements. Our management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2023, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K and did not have any commitments or contractual obligations. JOBS Act On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We will qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and under the JOBS Act will be allowed to comply with new or revised accounting 61",

The founder shares (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise thereof) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder. On August 11, 2023 and August 14, 2023, the Company entered into Non-Redemption Agreements with various unaffiliated third parties pursuant to which these shareholders have committed not to redeem 2,600,000 of their Class A ordinary shares at the Extraordinary General Meeting held on August 15, 2023. In consideration of this agreement, the Sponsor has agreed to transfer 568,750 of its Class B ordinary shares to such investors at the closing of the Business Combination. The Company estimated the aggregate fair value of the Sponsor shares attributable to the Non-Redemption Agreements to be $0.6 million or $0.97 per share. Our sponsor has purchased an aggregate of 11,360,000 private placement warrants for a purchase price of $0.75 per warrant in a private placement that occurred simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering. Each private placement warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The private placement warrants (including the warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of such warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our founder shares or warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination within the allotted time period or during any Extension Period. In addition, our sponsor purchased an additional 7,360,000 private placement warrants in connection with extending the time we will have to consummate an initial business combination by an additional 12 months. If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity.

Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made by us to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their affiliates and will determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf. Our sponsor has loaned us $150,000. This loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and is due on completion of our initial business combination. The value of our sponsor\u2019s interest in this transaction corresponds to the principal amount outstanding under any such loan. As of December 31, 2023, we had borrowed $150,000 under the note.

            "context": "REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp. V Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp. V (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related statements of operations, changes in shareholders\u2019 deficit and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Explanatory Paragraph\u2014Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company is a Special Purpose Acquisition Corporation that was formed for the purpose of completing a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses on or before August 17, 2024. There is no assurance that the Company will obtain the necessary approvals or raise the additional capital it needs to fund its business operations and complete any business combination prior to August 17, 2024, if at all. The Company also has no approved plan in place to extend the business combination deadline beyond August 17, 2024 and lacks the capital resources needed to fund operations and complete any business combination, even if the deadline to complete a business combination is extended to a later date. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Management\u2019s plans with regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Marcum LLP Marcum LLP We have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2021. Houston, TX March 29, 2024 F-2",

V (the \u201cCompany\u201d) was incorporated on March 19, 2021 as a Cayman Islands exempted company. The Company was incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the \u201cBusiness Combination\u201d). The Company is an emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with emerging growth companies. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from March 19, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2023 relates to the Company\u2019s formation and the initial public offering (the \u201cInitial Public Offering\u201d) described below, and since the Initial Public Offering, its search for a prospective initial Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company generates non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. The Company\u2019s sponsor is Kensington Capital Sponsor V LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the \u201cSponsor\u201d). The registration statement for the Company\u2019s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on August 12, 2021. On August 17, 2021, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering of 27,600,000 units (the \u201cUnits\u201d and, with respect to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units being offered, the \u201cPublic Shares\u201d), which includes the exercise in full of the underwriters\u2019 option to purchase 3,600,000 Units, at $ 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $ 276.0 million, and incurring offering costs of approximately $ 15.7 million, of which approximately $ 9.7 million and approximately $ 889,000 was for deferred underwriting commissions (see Note 5) and offering costs allocated to derivate warrant liabilities, respectively. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private placement (the \u201cInitial Private Placement\u201d and together with the Additional Private Placement (as defined below), the \u201cPrivate Placements\u201d) of 11,360,000 warrants (each, a \u201cPrivate Placement Warrant\u201d and collectively with the Additional Private Placement Warrants (as defined below), the \u201cPrivate Placement Warrants\u201d) at a price of $ 0.75 per Private Placement Warrant to the Sponsor, generating proceeds of approximately $ 8.5 million (see Note 4). Upon closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Initial Private Placement, $ 276.0 million ($ 10.00 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and of the Private Placement Warrants in the Initial Private Placement were placed in a trust account (the \u201cTrust Account\u201d) located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and invested only in U.S. \u201cgovernment securities,\u201d within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below. On each of August 4, 2022 and February 15, 2023, in connection with the Extensions as described below, the Company consummated an additional private placement (each, an \u201cAdditional Private Placement\u201d and collectively, the \u201cAdditional Private Placements\u201d) of 3,680,000 warrants (each, an \u201cAdditional Private Placement Warrant\u201d and collectively, the \u201cAdditional Private Placement Warrants\u201d) at a price of $ 0.75 per Additional Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds in aggregate of $ 5,520,000 . The Additional Private Placement Warrants were purchased by the Sponsor and are substantially similar to the Private Placement Warrants issued to the Sponsor at the time of the Company\u2019s Initial Public Offering. The Additional Private Placement Warrants were issued pursuant to, and are governed by, the Warrant Agreement that the Company entered into at the time of the Initial Public Offering. Upon closing of the Additional Private Placements, the proceeds received by the Company in connection with the issuance of the Additional Private Placement Warrants were deposited in the Trust Account.

            "context": "KENSINGTON CAPITAL ACQUISITION CORP. V NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS On August 11, 2023 and August 14, 2023, the Sponsor and the Company entered into agreements (the \u201cNon-Redemption Agreements\u201d) with several unaffiliated third parties in exchange for them agreeing not to redeem an aggregate of 2,600,000 Class A ordinary shares (the \u201cNon-Redeemed Shares\u201d) of the Company at the extraordinary general meeting called by the Company (the \u201cExtraordinary General Meeting\u201d) to approve, among other proposals, an extension of time for the Company to consummate an initial business combination from August 17, 2023 to August 17, 2024 (the \u201cExtension\u201d). In exchange for the foregoing commitment not to redeem such shares, the Sponsor has agreed to transfer to such investors an aggregate of 568,750 Class B ordinary shares of the Company held by the Sponsor immediately following the consummation of an initial business combination if they continue to hold such Non-Redeemed Shares through the Extraordinary General Meeting. The extension to consummate a business combination from August 17, 2023 to August 17, 2024 was approved by the Company\u2019s shareholders on August 15, 2023 and the investors subject to the Non-Redemption Agreements did not redeem their shares. The Company estimated the aggregate fair value of the Sponsor shares attributable to the Non-Redemption Agreements to be $ 0.6 million or $ 0.97 per share. In connection with the Extraordinary General Meeting, holders of 23,057,267 Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately $ 10.67 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $ 246.0 million. The Company\u2019s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company must complete an initial Business Combination with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80 % of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount). However, the Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50 % or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. The Company will provide holders of the Company\u2019s outstanding Class A ordinary shares, par value $ 0.0001 per share, sold in the Initial Public Offering (the \u201cPublic Shareholders\u201d) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then held in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay the Company\u2019s taxes, net of taxes payable, calculated as of two business days prior to the initial Business Combination. The per-share amount to be distributed to Public Shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters (as discussed in Note 5). These Public Shares were recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 480 \u201cDistinguishing Liabilities from Equity.\u201d The Company will proceed with a Business Combination if a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. The Company will not redeem the Public Shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets to be less than $ 5,000,001 . If a shareholder vote is not required by applicable law or stock exchange rule and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (the \u201cMemorandum and Articles\u201d), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and file tender offer documents with the SEC F-8",

The Sponsor and the Company\u2019s officers and directors (the \u201cinitial shareholders\u201d) agreed, pursuant to a letter agreement with the Company, that they will not propose any amendment to the Memorandum and Articles (A) to modify the substance or timing of the Company\u2019s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the initial Business Combination or to redeem 100 % of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination by August 17, 2024 (the \u201cCombination Period\u201d) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders\u2019 rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity, unless the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares. The Company initially had 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to consummate the initial Business Combination. However, if the Company anticipated that it may not be able to consummate the initial Business Combination within 12 months, the Company was permitted to, by resolution of its board of directors at the option of the Sponsor, extend the period of time the Company had to consummate an initial Business Combination up to two times, each by an additional 6 months (for a total of up to an additional 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering), subject to the Sponsor purchasing additional Private Placement Warrants. The Company\u2019s shareholders were not entitled to vote on or redeem their shares in connection with any such extension. Pursuant to the terms of the Memorandum and Articles, in order to extend the period of time to consummate an initial Business Combination in such a manner, the Sponsor had to purchase an additional 3,680,000 Private Placement Warrants, at a price of $ 0.75 per warrant, and deposit $ 0.10 per each Unit (for an aggregate of approximately $ 2.8 million), in proceeds into the Trust Account on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for each 6-month extension. On August 4, 2022 and February 15, 2023, the Company elected to extend the Combination Period by 6 months each time to August 17, 2023 (the \u201cExtensions\u201d). On July 28, 2023, the Company filed a definitive proxy statement for the solicitation of proxies in connection with the Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company\u2019s shareholders held on August 15, 2023 to consider and vote on, among other proposals, an amendment to the Company\u2019s Memorandum and Articles to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination from August 17, 2023 to August 17, 2024. The extension to consummate a business combination from August 17, 2023 to August 17, 2024 was approved by the Company\u2019s shareholders on August 15, 2023. The initial shareholders agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Founder Shares held by them if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the initial shareholders acquire Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period.

In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be only, or less than, $ 10.00 .

Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. Emerging Growth Company The Company is an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company\u2019s financial statements with another public company that is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

Liquidity and Going Concern As of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $ 1.2 million in its operating bank account and a working capital deficit of approximately $ 2.0 million. The Company\u2019s liquidity needs prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering were satisfied through the payment of $ 25,000 from the Sponsor to cover for certain expenses on behalf of the Company in exchange for issuance of Founder Shares (as defined in Note 4), and the loan from the Sponsor of approximately $ 150,000 under the Note (as defined in Note 4), which was converted into a Working Capital Loan (as defined in Note 4) on August 17, 2021. Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company\u2019s liquidity needs have been satisfied through the net proceeds from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the Initial Private Placement held outside of the Trust Account. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company\u2019s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company Working Capital Loans (see Note 4). As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the fair value of the Working Capital Loan was $ 150,000 (see Note 4). On August 29, 2023, the Sponsor loaned the Company an aggregate of up to $ 950,250 to cover expenses related to the Company\u2019s initial business combination pursuant to a promissory note (the \u201cSecond Note\u201d). The Second Note is noninterest bearing and payable on the earliest of: (i) the consummation of the Company\u2019s initial business combination unless converted into working capital warrants at the option of the Sponsor, at a price of $ 0.75 per warrant, as described in the registration statement that the Company filed in connection with the initial public offering of its securities, (ii) August 17, 2024, and (iii) the liquidation of the Company. Such working capital warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to the Sponsor in a private placement in connection with the Company\u2019s initial public offering.

In connection with our assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with the ASC 205-40, the Company has until August 17, 2024 to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time.

Management has determined that the liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. NOTE 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The accompanying financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. The financial information as of December 31, 2022, is derived from the audited financial statements presented in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on April 03, 2023. The Form 10-K had a typographical error in the Class B shares and Additional Paid in Capital balances reported on the Company\u2019s statements of changes in shareholders\u2019 deficit for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, whereby Class B shares of 0 and $ 0 should have been reported as 6,900,000 and $ 690 and additional paid in capital of $ 24,310 should have been reported as $ 0 . Class B shares and additional paid in capital were reported correctly in the balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 within the Form 10-K. The Company has corrected this typographical error in the accompanying statements of changes in shareholders\u2019 deficit. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Investments Held in Trust Account The Company\u2019s portfolio of investments is comprised of U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or investments in money market funds that invest in U.S. government securities and generally have a readily determinable fair value, or a combination thereof. When the Company\u2019s investments held in the Trust Account are comprised of U.S. government securities, the investments are classified as trading securities. When the Company\u2019s F-12",

V NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The 20,700,000 warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering (the \u201cPublic Warrants\u201d) and the 18,720,000 Private Placement Warrants are recognized as derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40. Accordingly, the Company recognizes the warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjusts the instruments to fair value at each reporting period. The liabilities are subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in the Company\u2019s statements of operations. The fair value of the Public Warrants issued in connection with the Public Offering were initially estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. For periods where no observable traded price is available, the fair value continues to be estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation. The fair value of the Private Placement Warrants is determined using Black-Scholes option pricing model. The determination of the fair value of the warrant liability may be subject to change as more current information becomes available and accordingly the actual results could differ significantly. Derivative warrant liabilities are classified as non-current liabilities as their liquidation is not reasonably expected to require the use of current assets or require the creation of current liabilities. Working Capital Loan-Related Party The Company has elected the fair value option to account for its Working Capital Loan with its Sponsor as defined and more fully described in Note 4. As a result of applying the fair value option, the Company records the loan fair value with a gain or loss recognized at issuance, and subsequent changes in fair value are recorded as change in the fair value of Working Capital Loan reported in the statements of operations. The fair value is based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs reflect management\u2019s and, if applicable, an independent third-party valuation firm\u2019s own assumption about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. Offering Costs Associated with Initial Public Offering Offering costs consisted of legal, accounting, underwriting fees and other costs incurred through the Initial Public Offering that were directly related to the Initial Public Offering. Offering costs were allocated to the separable financial instruments issued in the Initial Public Offering based on a relative fair value basis, compared to total proceeds received. Offering costs associated with derivative warrant liabilities were expensed as incurred and presented as non-operating expenses in the statements of operations. Offering costs associated with the Class A ordinary shares were charged against the carrying value of Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering. The Company classifies deferred underwriting commissions as non-current liabilities as their liquidation is not reasonably expected to require the use of current assets or require the creation of current liabilities Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption The Company accounts for its Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480. Class A ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Class A ordinary shares (including Class A ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company\u2019s control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Class A ordinary shares are classified as shareholders\u2019 equity. The Company\u2019s Class A ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company\u2019s control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, 4,542,733 and 27,600,000 Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders\u2019 deficit section of the Company\u2019s condensed balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

Deferred tax assets were deemed de minimis as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and a full valuation allowance was recorded against such deferred tax assets. FASB ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. There were no unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2023. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. No amounts were accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. There is currently no taxation imposed on income by the Government of the Cayman Islands. In accordance with Cayman income tax regulations, income taxes are not levied on the Company. Consequently, income taxes are not reflected in the Company\u2019s financial statements. The Company\u2019s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, ASC Subtopic 820 \u201cFair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions\u201d. The ASU amends ASC 820 to clarify that a contractual sales restriction is not considered in measuring an equity security at fair value and to introduce new disclosure requirements for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions that are measured at fair value. The ASU applies to both holders and issuers of equity and equity-linked securities measured at fair value. The amendments in this ASU are effective for the Company in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for both interim and annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. The Company is still evaluating the impact of this pronouncement on the financial statements. The Company\u2019s management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements. NOTE 3. INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING On August 17, 2021, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering of 27,600,000 Units, which includes the exercise in full of the underwriters\u2019 option to purchase 3,600,000 Units, at $ 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $ 276.0 million, and incurring offering costs of approximately $ 15.7 million, of which approximately $ 9.7 million and approximately $ 889,000 was for deferred underwriting commissions and offering costs allocated to derivate warrant liabilities, respectively. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share (such shares included in the Units being offered, the \u201cPublic Shares\u201d), and three-fourths of one redeemable warrant (each, a \u201cPublic Warrant\u201d). Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $ 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (see Note 7). NOTE 4.

Shares and the associated amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect: (i) the surrender of 1,006,250 Class B ordinary shares to the Company for no consideration on August 6, 2021; and (ii) the share issue of 431,250 Class B ordinary shares on August 12, 2021; resulting in an aggregate of 6,900,000 Class B ordinary shares outstanding. The initial shareholders agreed to forfeit up to 900,000 Founder Shares to the extent that the over-allotment option was not exercised in full by the underwriters, so that the Founder Shares would represent 20.0 % of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding ordinary shares after the Initial Public Offering. The underwriters fully exercised the over-allotment on August 17, 2021; thus, these 900,000 Founder Shares were no longer subject to forfeiture. The initial shareholders agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of: (A) one year after the completion of the initial Business Combination or (B) subsequent to the initial Business Combination, (x) if the last reported sale price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $ 12.00 per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions, share capitalization, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30 -trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the initial Business Combination, or (y) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, share exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of the Company\u2019s shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property. Private Placement Warrants Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the Initial Private Placement of 11,360,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of $ 0.75 per Private Placement Warrant to the Sponsor, generating proceeds of approximately $ 8.5 million. Each whole Private Placement Warrant is exercisable for one whole Class A ordinary share at a price of $ 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants to the Sponsor was added to the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless. The Private Placement Warrants will be non-redeemable for cash and exercisable on a cashless basis. The Sponsor agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell the Private Placement Warrants until 30 days after the completion of the initial Business Combination. On each of August 4, 2022 and February 15, 2023, the Company consummated the Additional Private Placements of 3,680,000 Additional Private Placement Warrants at a price of $ 0.75 per Additional Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds in aggregate of $ 5,520,000 . The Additional Private Placement Warrants were purchased by the Sponsor and are substantially similar to the Private Placement Warrants issued to the Sponsor at the time of the Company\u2019s Initial Public Offering. The Additional Private Placement Warrants have been issued pursuant to, and are governed by, the Warrant Agreement that the Company entered into at the time of the Initial Public Offering. Upon closing of the Additional Private Placements, the proceeds received by the Company in connection with the issuance of the Additional Private Placement Warrants were deposited in the Trust Account.

The Sponsor elected to convert the Note into a Working Capital Loan upon closing of the Initial Public Offering. In addition, in order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company\u2019s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (\u201cWorking Capital Loans\u201d).

On August 29, 2023, the Sponsor loaned the Company an aggregate of up to $ 950,250 to cover expenses related to the Company\u2019s initial business combination pursuant to a promissory note (the \u201cSecond Note\u201d). The Second Note is noninterest bearing and payable on the earliest of: (i) the consummation of the Company\u2019s initial business combination unless converted into working capital warrants at the option of the Sponsor, at a price of $ 0.75 per warrant, as described in the registration statement that the Company filed in connection with the initial public offering of its securities, (ii) August 17, 2024, and (iii) the liquidation of the Company. Such working capital warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to the Sponsor in a private placement in connection with the Company\u2019s initial public offering. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the fair value of the Second Note was $ 950,250 and $ 0 , respectively.

On August 29, 2023, the agreement was amended to extend the services for the period from August 17, 2023 to August 17, 2024 with the same monthly payment. For the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred $ 120,000 and $ 240,000 for such expenses, respectively, included as general and administrative expenses-related party on the statements of operations contained herein. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no outstanding balance for services in connection with such agreement. The Sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on the Company\u2019s behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable Business Combinations. The Company\u2019s audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made by the Company to the Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates. Non-Redemption Agreements On August 11, 2023 and August 14, 2023, the Company entered into Non-Redemption Agreements with various unaffiliated third parties pursuant to which these shareholders have committed not to redeem 2,600,000 of their F-18",

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were 6,900,000 Class B ordinary shares issued and outstanding, which amounts have been adjusted to reflect the shares surrendered as discussed in Note 4. Shareholders of record are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by shareholders; provided that, prior to the completion of the initial Business Combination, holders of the Class B ordinary shares will have the right to elect all of the Company\u2019s directors and remove members of the Company\u2019s board of directors for any reason. Prior to the completion of the initial Business Combination, only holders of the Class B ordinary shares will have the right to vote on the Company\u2019s appointment of directors. Holders of the Public Shares will not be entitled to vote on the Company\u2019s appointment of directors during such time. In addition, prior to the completion of the initial Business Combination, holders of a majority of the outstanding Class B ordinary shares may remove a member of the Company\u2019s board of directors for any reason. These provisions of the Memorandum and Articles may only be amended by a resolution passed by at least two-thirds (2/3) of all holders (which must include a simple majority of the holders of Class B ordinary shares).
