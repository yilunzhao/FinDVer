On November 20, 2014, the Company completed a listing process on the Canadian Securities Exchange (\"CSE\"). As part of that process, the Company acquired 100% of the members\u2019 interests of Pinon Ridge Mining LLC (\"PRM\"), a Delaware limited liability company. The transaction constituted a reverse takeover (\u201cRTO\u201d) of Western by PRM.

In parallel, additional capital flowed into nuclear ETFs and uranium equities through April, but began to reverse in May. This equity price action followed U3O8 spot prices which began the year at $42, rallied to a $64 peak by mid-April before beginning to decline by mid-May. During the last nine months of 2022, SPUT became a smaller factor as less than 6 million lbs. of U3O8 were purchased.",

In the prior bull market, spot prices rose from $21 per pound in January 2005 to a high of $136 per pound in June 2007 in anticipation of sharply higher projected demand as a result of a resurgence in nuclear power and the depletion of secondary supplies. Secondary supplies are inventories of uranium not publicly available for sale, which are primarily held by utility companies and governments. The sharp price increase was driven in part by high levels of buying by utility companies, which resulted in most utilities covering their requirements through 2009. A decrease in near-term utility demand coupled with rising levels of supplies from producers and traders led to downward pressure on uranium prices beginning in the third quarter of 2007.

In response to the military action by Russia, various countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and European Union issued broad-ranging economic sanctions against Russia and its companies, institutions, officials and oligarchs. Additional sanctions have been and may be imposed in the future. Such sanctions (and any future sanctions) and other actions against Russia may adversely impact, among other things, the Russian economy and various sectors of the economy, including but not limited to, financial, energy, metals and mining, engineering and defense and defense-related materials sectors; result in a decline in the value and liquidity of Russian securities; result in boycotts, tariffs, and purchasing and financing restrictions on Russia\u2019s government, companies and certain individuals; weaken the value of the ruble; downgrade the country\u2019s credit rating; freeze Russian securities and/or funds invested in prohibited assets and impair the ability to trade in Russian securities and/or other assets; and have other adverse consequences on the Russian government, economy, companies and region. Further, several large corporations and U.S. states have announced plans to divest interests or otherwise curtail business dealings with certain Russian businesses.",

Furthermore, locations of interface zones of the oxidized and reduced environments are hard to predict. Until more historic data are obtained and/or more drilling occurs on the property away from the historic mines, these outlying areas remain exploration targets.",

The site was first exploited by Ed Haggerty, a prospector from Whitehaven, England, in 1897, when he established the Rudefeha Mine on a rich deposit of copper ore. Haggerty was backed by George Ferris and other investors, of whom all but Ferris dropped out. The partners sold an interest to Willis George Emerson, who raised investment funding for improvements to the mine. These facilities included a 16-mile (26 km) aerial tramway from Grand Encampment over the Continental Divide to the smelter in Encampment and a 4-mile (6.4 km) pipeline to the mine. The mine's assets were eventually acquired by the North American Copper Company for $1 million. By 1904 the mine had produced $1.4 million in copper ore, and was sold to the Penn-Wyoming Copper Company. However, even with copper prices peaking in 1907, the company had difficulty making a profit from the remove mine site. The company was over-capitalized and under-insured, and was suffered devastating fires at the mine site in March 1906 and May 1907 which halted production. Business disputes and a fall in copper prices prevented re-opening of the mine even after it was rebuilt. Machinery was salvaged after a foreclosure in 1913. A total of $2 million in copper ore was extracted from the mine during its life.",

Mineralization at the Ferris-Haggarty mine consists of disseminated pyrite and chalcopyrite grains that occur along bedding planes of the host quartzite. However, the massive ore body mined at the Ferris-Haggarty was described by Spencer (1904) to lie along quartzite-Schist contacts and to cross cut foliation. Based on the historic description, the ore may have been remobilized from the host quartzite during regional metamorphism and emplaced along the quartzite-schist contact by way of permeable fractures.

At issue was the application of an unchallenged Colorado Court of Appeals Opinion for a separate mine (Van 4) with very different facts that are retroactively modifying DRMS rules and regulations. The Company maintains that it was timely in meeting existing rules and regulations. The hearing was scheduled to be held during several monthly MLRB Board meetings, but this matter was delayed several times. The permit hearing was held during the MLRB Board monthly meeting on July 22, 2020. At issue was the status of the five existing permits which comprise the Sunday Mine Complex. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the hearing took place utilizing a virtual-only format. The Company prevailed in a 3 to 1 decision which acknowledged that the work completed at the Sunday Mine Complex under DRMS oversight was timely and sufficient for Western to maintain these permits. In a subsequent July 30, 2020 letter, the DRMS notified the Company that the status of the five permits (Sunday, West Sunday, St. Jude, Carnation, and Topaz) had been changed to \u201cActive\u201d status effective June 10, 2019, the original date on which the change of the status was approved. On August 23, 2020, the Company initiated a request for Temporary Cessation status for the Sunday Mine Complex as the mines had not been restarted within a 180-day window due to the direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, a permit hearing was scheduled for October 21, 2020 to determine Temporary Cessation status. In a unanimous vote, the MLRB approved Temporary Cessation status for each of the five Sunday Mine Complex permits (Sunday, West Sunday, St. Jude, Carnation, and Topaz). On October 9, 2020, the MLRB issued a board order which finalized the findings of the July 22, 2020 permit hearing. On November 10, 2020, the MLRB issued a board order which finalized the findings of the October 21, 2020 permit hearing. On November 6, 2020, the MLRB signed an order placing the five Sunday Mine Complex mine permits into Temporary Cessation. On November 12, 2020, a coalition of environmental groups (the \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) filed a complaint against the MLRB seeking a partial appeal of the July 22, 2020 decision by requesting termination of the Topaz Mine permit. On December 15, 2020, the same coalition of environmental groups amended their complaint against the MLRB seeking a partial appeal of the October 21, 2020 decision requesting termination of the Topaz Mine permit. The Company has joined with the MLRB in defense of their July 22, 2020 and October 21, 2020 decisions. On May 5, 2021, the Plaintiffs in the Topaz Appeal filed an opening brief with the Denver District Court seeking to overturn the July 22, 2020 and October 21, 2020 MLRB permit hearing decisions on the Topaz Mine permit. The MLRB and the Company were to respond with an answer brief within 35 days on or before June 9, 2021, but instead sought a settlement. The judicial review process was delayed as extensions were put in place until August 20, 2021. A settlement was not reached, and the MLRB and the Company submitted answer briefs on August 20, 2021. The Plaintiff submitted a reply brief on September 10, 2021. On March 1, 2022, the Denver District Court reversed the MLRB\u2019s orders regarding the Topaz Mine and remanded the case back to MLRB for further proceedings consistent with its order. The Company and the MLRB had until April 19, 2022 to appeal the Denver District Court\u2019s ruling. Neither the Company nor the MLRB appealed the Denver District Court ruling. Subsequently on March 20, 2023, the MLRB issued a board order for the Company to commence final reclamation, which upon completion will terminate mining operations at the Topaz Mine. Reclamation is to commence immediately at the Topaz Mine and is to be completed within five years by March 2028. The Company is currently working toward the completion of an updated Topaz Mine Plan of Operations which is a separate federal requirement of the BLM for the conduct of mining activities on the federal land at the Topaz Mine and needed to re-permit the Topaz Mine with Colorado\u2019s DRMS. The review of Western\u2019s most recent submission continues to be delayed due to staff turnover at the BLM.",

Underground development began in August 2021 following mine ventilation, power upgrades, and increasing explosive capabilities. The first target was the extension of the drift (tunnel) 150 feet to reach the first surface exploration drill hole to access the GMG Ore Body (GMG). Early results were positive as drilling toward the GMG resulted in the location of ore-grade material within thirty feet of the existing mine workings. Notably, only limited exploration drilling has been done in this area due to the mountainous terrain on the surface above. As drifting proceeded, very high-grade ore continued to be intersected through the drift path and on both sides of the drift. As a result, the team shifted from development to mining.",

Since this transition began in spring 2022, additional employees have been hired to support mining operations and mining equipment and vehicles have been acquired to support deployment of two (2) fully equipped mining teams. The equipment has been prepared for operations and deployed; site infrastructure upgrades have been finished. In early 2023, the mines were reopened for ventilation and infrastructure upgrades. Mining operations restarted in April 2023 and initially focused on additional development of the GMG Ore Body, where high-grade uranium ore was continuously intersected. Western\u2019s in-house mining team drove this drift to less than 30 feet of reaching the target ore hole. At that point, the GMG Ore Body was deemed ready for full-scale production. As a result of the encouraging results, the in-house mining team refocused on other high value target areas that were never drilled due to the mountainous terrain limiting surface exploration drilling.

Notably, while protecting the climate, there is a leveling of the playing field with renewable energy, which has long benefited from government support. We see the benefits to nuclear split across existing reactors, new advanced reactors, low enriched uranium and high-assay low enriched uranium nuclear fuels, and in multiple stages of the domestic nuclear fuel cycle.

Since July 2023, spot uranium increased from the approximately $50/lbs level to over $100/lbs in January 2024, before receding below the $88/lbs level at the end of March 2024. The events of 2022 have set in motion uranium market and nuclear fuel opportunities for the next decade and beyond. There are positive catalysts across multiple levels of the nuclear fuel and uranium markets. Underlying fundamentals are the strongest in decades. This is attributable to multiple factors, including climate change, energy security, supply chain and energy scarcity initiatives. The supply/demand imbalance has flipped from a market with excess supply into a market with excess future demand. With the reduced availability of secondary supplies, utilities have begun adding multi-year contracts with mining companies for primary supply. The drivers expanding the demand for nuclear fuel include non-nuclear nations adding nuclear power generation, nuclear nations expanding fleets and/or extending lives of existing reactors, idled nuclear reactors being redeployed, the reversal of phase-outs and shutdowns, and the deployment of advanced reactors / SMRs. However, the challenge is in meeting increasing demand simultaneously with supply constraints from the world\u2019s largest suppliers. We believe uranium equity prices will continue to strengthen and reflect the underlying positive fundamentals in the nuclear/uranium sector.

In spite of the dominant market position of Rosatom, future deliveries potentially could be at risk due to sanctions, legislation, or a Russian embargo. Customer dependence upon the Russian supply of uranium, conversion and enrichment are being addressed slowly by governments as alternative suppliers are not currently available. Since last quarter both Urenco and Orano have announced that they will invest to expand their uranium enrichment capacity respectively in the United States and France, which represents a shift away from Russia. Utilities are demonstrating their desire for increased security of their nuclear fuel supply chains. Kazakhstan is also a concern because the world\u2019s largest uranium producing country has an unguarded and the second longest continuous land border in the world shared with Russia. The potential exists for Russia to exert influence over Kazakhstan. Additionally, Kazatomprom is currently working toward putting large long-term contracts in place with China. This supply is needed for China to fulfill its 15 year plan to deploy 150 new nuclear reactors. China National Nuclear Corp.

The reclamation liability represents the Company\u2019s best estimate of the present value of future reclamation costs in connection with the mineral properties. The Company determined the gross reclamation liabilities of the mineral properties to be $ 751,444 and $ 751,405 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The portion of the reclamation liability related to the Van 4 Mine, which is in reclamation as of December 31, 2023, and its related restricted cash are included in current liabilities and current assets, respectively, at a value of $ 75,057 .

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Stated in USD)\nNOTE 4 - PROPERTY, PLANT & EQUIPMENT AND MINERAL PROPERTIES, NET AND KINETIC SEPARATION INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, continued\nSunday Mine Complex Permitting Status On February 4, 2020, the Colorado Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety (the \u201cDRMS\u201d) sent a Notice of Hearing to Declare Termination of Mining Operations related to the status of the mining permits issued by the state of Colorado for the Sunday Mine Complex. At issue was the application of an unchallenged Colorado Court of Appeals Opinion for a separate mine (Van 4) with very different facts that are retroactively modifying DRMS rules and regulations. The Company maintains that it was timely in meeting existing rules and regulations. The hearing was scheduled to be held during several monthly Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Board (the \u201cMLRB\u201d) Board meetings, but this matter was delayed several times. The permit hearing was held during the MLRB Board monthly meeting on July 22, 2020. At issue was the status of the five existing permits which comprise the Sunday Mine Complex. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the hearing took place utilizing a virtual-only format. The Company prevailed in a 3 to 1 decision which acknowledged that the work completed at the Sunday Mine Complex under DRMS oversight was timely and sufficient for Western to maintain these permits. In a subsequent July 30, 2020 letter, the DRMS notified the Company that the status of the five permits (Sunday, West Sunday, St. Jude, Carnation, and Topaz) had been changed to \u201cActive\u201d status effective June 10, 2019, the original date on which the change of the status was approved. On August 23, 2020, the Company initiated a request for Temporary Cessation status for the Sunday Mine Complex as the mines had not been restarted within a 180-day window due to the direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, a permit hearing was scheduled for October 21, 2020 to determine Temporary Cessation status. In a unanimous vote, the MLRB approved Temporary Cessation status for each of the five Sunday Mine Complex permits (Sunday, West Sunday, St. Jude, Carnation, and Topaz). On October 9, 2020, the MLRB issued a board order which finalized the findings of the July 22, 2020 permit hearing. On November 10, 2020, the MLRB issued a board order which finalized the findings of the October 21, 2020 permit hearing. On November 6, 2020, the MLRB signed an order placing the five Sunday Mine Complex mine permits into Temporary Cessation. On November 12, 2020, a coalition of environmental groups (the \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) filed a complaint against the MLRB seeking a partial appeal of the July 22, 2020 decision by requesting termination of the Topaz Mine permit. On December 15, 2020, the same coalition of environmental groups amended their complaint against the MLRB seeking a partial appeal of the October 21, 2020 decision requesting termination of the Topaz Mine permit. The Company has joined with the MLRB in defense of their July 22, 2020 and October 21, 2020 decisions. On May 5, 2021, the Plaintiffs in the Topaz Appeal filed an opening brief with the Denver District Court seeking to overturn the July 22, 2020 and October 21, 2020 MLRB permit hearing decisions on the Topaz Mine permit. The MLRB and the Company were to respond with an answer brief within 35 days on or before June 9, 2021, but instead sought a settlement. The judicial review process was delayed as extensions were put in place until August 20, 2021. A settlement was not reached, and the MLRB and the Company submitted answer briefs on August 20, 2021. The Plaintiff submitted a reply brief on September 10, 2021. On March 1, 2022, the Denver District Court reversed the MLRB\u2019s orders regarding the Topaz Mine and remanded the case back to MLRB for further proceedings consistent with its order. The Company and the MLRB had until April 19, 2022 to appeal the Denver District Court\u2019s ruling. Neither the Company nor the MLRB appealed the Denver District Court ruling. Subsequently on March 20, 2023, the MLRB issued a board order for the Company to commence final reclamation, which upon completion will terminate mining operations at the Topaz Mine. Reclamation is to commence immediately at the Topaz Mine and is to be completed within five years by March 2028. The Company is currently working toward the completion of an updated Topaz Mine Plan of Operations which is a separate federal requirement of the BLM for the conduct of mining activities on the federal land at the Topaz Mine and needed to re-permit the Topaz Mine with Colorado\u2019s DRMS. The review of Western\u2019s most recent submission continues to be delayed due to staff turnover at the BLM.",
