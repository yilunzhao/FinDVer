If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party\u2019s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account or any amount that may be deposited into the trust account to extend the date by which the Company has to complete a business combination, our sponsor agreed that it will be liable to us, if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below $10.10 per share, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. However, our sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. Other than as described above, none of our other officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy his indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor\u2019s only assets are securities of our company. We believe the likelihood of our sponsor having to indemnify the trust account is limited because we will endeavor to have all vendors and prospective target businesses as well as other entities execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account.",

The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.",

As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company is a Special Purpose Acquisition Corporation that was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses on or before April 17, 2024, by depositing into the Trust account a specified amount for each of the one-month extensions through April 17, 2024. On February 15, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger with a business combination target. The plan of merger was approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders on March 4, 2024. However, there is no assurance that the Company will obtain the necessary approvals, satisfy the required closing conditions, or raise the additional capital it needs to fund further business operations prior to April 17, 2024, if at all. The Company also has no approved plan in place to extend the business combination deadline and fund operations for any period of time after April 17, 2024, in the event that it is unable to complete a business combination by that date. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Management\u2019s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1.

First, the accretion method is one of the two accounting methods supported by ASC 480-10-S99. Second, justification for the change is rational in terms of presenting financial position and results of operations. When evaluating a change in accounting methods, the Company considered several factors such as: 1) conformity with broad concept of accounting (i.e., more accurate reflection of permanent and temporary equity) and 2) suitability in light of business circumstances, plans and policies (i.e., compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements and the Company\u2019s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association).
