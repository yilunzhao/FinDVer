What makes us be different from other manufacturers would be that we will have the flexibility to use raw materials from sustainable sources. In order to reach the ambitious goal of net zero greenhouse gas emission by 2050, thorough examination of the entire supply chain line can show insufficiencies. With the increasing trend of EVs on the road, proliferation of renewable energy \u2013 battery systems, the scrutiny of battery material production impacts on the environment becomes increasingly relevant. Graphite is currently indispensable as a battery anode material, dominating the vast majority of the rechargeable battery market due to its long-term cycle life and low cost of production. Synthetic graphite is currently produced almost exclusively from petroleum coke and pitch. Solidion proposes to manufacture battery-grade anode materials by introducing renewable and carbon negative biochar produced from waste biomass as alternative feedstock. By collecting dead trees, trimming, and other waste biomass, the process of creating biochar sequesters the elemental carbon and prevents the release of carbon as green-house gas through natural decomposition or wildfires. Hence the process of converting waste biomass to biochar has been shown to be carbon neutral or even negative depending on the end use of the biochar. Given that biochar when mixed into soil, can remain sequestered for scale of thousand years, it will likely remain as sequestered carbon in a sealed cell until recycled and reused, hence prolonging its sequestered state. Solidion has developed a process technology that is expected to allow cost-effective production of anode-grade graphite from this unique sustainable source. Subject to the Supply and License Agreement we entered into with G3, Solidion is allowed to manufacture graphene and graphite products for use in our battery-related products and prohibits resale of the manufactured graphene and graphite products other than after modification to create electrode materials.",

This portfolio contains many key patents for next generation EV batteries. Solidion is the inventor of graphene-enabled batteries, elastic polymer-protected batteries, quasi-solid electrolytes, elastomeric solid-state electrolytes, advanced polymer/inorganic hybrid electrolytes, and numerous other disruptive battery technologies. This massive intellectual portfolio provides the EV industry with what we believe to be several key enabling battery technologies, such as silicon-rich anode having the highest performance/cost ratio, the highest-capacity sulfur cathode materials (free of cobalt, nickel and manganese), the most process-friendly solid-state electrolytes, protected lithium metal anode, fast chargeability, aluminum-ion cells and sodium-ion cells. Solidion holds more than 100 key U.S. patents on graphene- or polymer-enhanced silicon-based materials. It holds more than 35 key U.S. patents on fire-resistant electrolytes for lithium batteries. It holds more than 70 U.S. patents on key technologies for next-generation all-solid state or lithium metal batteries. It also holds advanced current collector patents; these technologies are capable of extending cycle life and improving operating temperatures and voltages. The year of expiration of these key U.S. patents generally ranges from as early as 2028 to as late as 2040. Most of the intellectual property to be utilized by Solidion is intellectual property that is owned by Solidion (having been transferred from G3 to Solidion via the Patent Assignment, dated as of February 8, 2023 (the \u201cPatent Assignment\u201d)). Solidion licenses a relatively small number of patents relating to graphene and graphite production from G3 pursuant to the Supply and License Agreement, under which there are no significant limitations.

The U.S. government has and continues to make significant changes in U.S. trade policy and has taken certain actions that could negatively impact U.S. trade, including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported into the United States. In retaliation, China has implemented, and continues to evaluate imposing additional tariffs on a wide range of American products. There is also a concern that the imposition of additional tariffs by the United States could result in the adoption of tariffs by other countries as well, leading to a global trade war. More specifically, the U.S. government has from time to time imposed significant tariffs on certain product categories imported from China. Such tariffs, if expanded to other categories, could have a significant impact on our business, particularly the importation of parts of our batteries and certain production equipment that are manufactured in China. If we attempt to renegotiate prices with suppliers or diversify our supply chain in response to tariffs, such efforts may not yield immediate results or may be ineffective. We might also consider increasing prices to the end consumer; however, this could reduce the competitiveness of our products and adversely affect net sales. If we fail to manage these dynamics successfully, gross margins and profitability could be adversely affected. As of the date of this report, tariffs have not had a material impact on our business, but increased tariffs or trade restrictions implemented by the United States or other countries in connection with a global trade war could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected to avail ourselves of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company that is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.",
