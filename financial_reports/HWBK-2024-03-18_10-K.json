Under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the \"Riegle-Neal Act\"), a bank holding company is permitted to acquire the stock or substantially all of the assets of banks located in any state regardless of whether such transaction is prohibited under the laws of any state. The FRB will not approve an interstate acquisition if, as a result of the acquisition, the bank holding company would control more than 10% of the total amount of insured deposits in the U.S. or would control more than 30% of the insured deposits in the home state of the acquired bank. The 30% of insured deposits state limit does not apply if the acquisition is the initial entry into a state by a bank holding company or if the home state waives such limit. The Riegle-Neal Act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines, thereby creating interstate branches. The Bank and Savings Association Holding Company and Depository Institution Regulatory Improvements Act of 2010, a subset of the Dodd-Frank Act (defined below), permits banks to acquire and establish de novo branches in other states if a state bank in that other state would be permitted to establish the branch.",

A state may prohibit an out-of-state bank holding company from acquiring a bank located in the state unless the target bank has been in existence for a specified minimum period of time (not to exceed five years). A state may also establish limits on the total amount of insured deposits within the state which are controlled by a single bank holding company, provided that such deposit limit does not discriminate against out-of-state bank holding companies.",

In addition, there are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid, risks relating to proper loan underwriting, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions and risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers.

Furthermore, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Bank's loan portfolio, provision for credit losses, and real estate acquired by foreclosure. Such agencies may require the Bank to recognize additions to the provision for credit losses based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of the examination.

The FDIC's Changes in the Calculation of Deposit Insurance Premiums and Ability to Levy Special Assessments Could Increase the Company's Non-Interest Expense and May Reduce Its Profitability. The range of base assessment rates historically varies from 12 to 45 basis points depending on an institution's risk category, with newly added financial measures resulting in increased assessment rates for institutions heavily relying on brokered deposits to support rapid asset growth. However, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to amend its regulations to redefine the assessment base used for calculating deposit insurance assessments. On February 9, 2011, the FDIC adopted a final rule that defines the assessment base as the average consolidated total assets during the assessment period minus the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period. The FDIC also imposed a new assessment rate scale (which was revised further in 2016). Under the new system, banks will generally pay assessments at a rate between 2.5 and 32 basis points per assets minus tangible equity, depending upon an institution's risk category (the final rule also includes progressively lower assessment rate schedules when the FDIC's reserve ratio reaches certain levels). The rulemaking changes the current assessment rate schedule so the schedule will result in the collection of assessment revenue that is approximately the same as generated under the current rate schedule and current assessment base. Nearly all banks with assets less than $10 billion will pay smaller deposit insurance assessments as a result of the new rule. The majority of the changes in the FDIC's final rule became effective on April 1, 2011. The FDIC has the statutory authority to impose special assessments on insured depository institutions in an amount, and for such purposes, as the FDIC may deem necessary. The FDIC issued a final rule in November 2023 to implement a special assessment to recover the significant losses incurred by the FDIC in connection with the 2023 bank failures, but that special assessment did not apply to the Bank. The change in the calculation methodology for deposit insurance premiums and the possible emergency special assessments could increase non-interest expense and may adversely affect the Company's profitability.",
