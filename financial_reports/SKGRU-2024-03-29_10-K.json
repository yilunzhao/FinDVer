Society today is undergoing profound change through technological advancements and innovation. New paradigms are required to better conceptualize the relationship between business and society. As such, companies can no longer focus exclusively on their customers, employees, and shareholders, but must also consider their impact on affected communities and members of the wider public. It is our vision to help be a driver of this change and we are focused on acquiring a sustainable business with a double bottom-line focus. We believe that for-profit companies can play an integral role in supporting the social enterprise ecosystem to drive up the sustainability of these entities and to ensure they continue to maximize social value. We believe traditional business models must be superseded by ones that are articulated around the joint generation of financial returns and social impact. The idea behind this forward-thinking model is that both of these objectives are mutually reinforcing and can be grown simultaneously and steadily.",

To the extent the aggregate amount of our Class B ordinary shares to be forfeited by our sponsor pursuant to such additional Non-Redemption Agreements is less than 2,000,000, our sponsor will forfeit an additional amount of our Class B ordinary shares on the Closing Date and immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time, such that our sponsor will forfeit an aggregate of 2,000,000 Class B ordinary shares pursuant to such additional Non-Redemption Agreements and the Sponsor Support Agreement. In addition, on the terms and subject to the conditions of the Sponsor Support Agreement, following the closing of the Business Combination until 30 days following the expiration of the statute of limitations for the applicable taxes (or if an audit is commenced during this period, until the completion of the audit), subject to the occurrence of certain triggering events, Webull agreed to indemnify our sponsor and each other SPAC Insiders for any U.S. federal (and applicable U.S. state and U.S. local) income taxes, together with any interests and penalties (the \u201cIndemnifiable Amounts\u201d) payable by our sponsor or the other SPAC Insiders, as applicable, solely arising from or attributable to the failure of the Mergers to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) or as an exchange described in Section 351 of the Code, provided, however, that Webull shall not have any liability in respect of any Indemnifiable Amounts to the extent that the aggregate amount of such Indemnifiable Amounts exceeds $5,000,000.

Our review process may include, among other things, detailed document reviews, financial analysis, technology reviews, management meetings, consultations with customers, competitors, and industry experts as well as review of other information that will be made available to us. We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with SK, our sponsor, officers, or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with such a company, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions, that such an initial business combination is fair to our shareholders from a financial point of view. In the event we pursue an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with SK, such transactions may be subject to local Korean laws and regulations that require, among other things, a filing and approval by local regulators. Members of our management team and our board of directors may directly or indirectly own our securities following our initial public offering, and accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. Certain of our officers and directors have formerly been employed by or affiliated with SK. As a global investor, SK is continuously made aware of potential investment opportunities, one or more of which may present an opportunity for a business combination, but we have not (nor has anyone on our behalf) contacted any prospective target business or had any discussions, formal or otherwise, with respect to a business combination transaction with any prospective target business. Certain of our directors and officers presently have, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our directors or officers becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity before we can pursue such opportunity. We do not believe, however, that any of the foregoing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our directors or officers will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on one hand, and us, on the other. Our initial shareholders and our officers and directors may sponsor or form other blank check companies similar to ours or may pursue other business or investment ventures during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. As a result, our initial shareholders, officers, and directors could have conflicts of interest in determining whether to present business combination opportunities to us or to any other blank check company with which they may become involved. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. In addition, certain of our officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. 12",

            "context": "Initial Business Combination Nasdaq listing rules require that our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions held in trust and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board of directors is less familiar or experienced with the target company\u2019s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company\u2019s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board of directors determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business meets the 80% fair market value test, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to shareholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion. We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d). Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. If our securities are not then listed on the Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of fair market value test. To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. 13",

The Non-Redemption Agreements increased the amount of funds that remain in the company\u2019s trust account following the Extension Meeting. Other Considerations We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with SK, our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we enter into such a transaction, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such initial business combination is fair to our shareholders from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context but may obtain such an opinion as part of our due diligence and evaluation of an initial business combination. In the event we pursue an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with SK, such transactions may be subject to local Korean laws and regulations that require, among other things, a filing and approval by local regulators. In addition, our initial shareholders, officers and directors or any of their affiliates may make additional investments in the company in connection with the initial business combination, although our initial shareholders, officers and directors and their affiliates have no obligation or current intention to do so. If our initial shareholders, officers and directors or any of their affiliates elect to make additional investments, such proposed investment could influence our initial shareholders\u2019, officers\u2019 and directors\u2019 motivations to complete an initial business combination. Our initial shareholders, officers and directors may sponsor, form or participate in other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target, particularly in the event there is overlap among investment mandates. However, we do not currently expect that any such other blank check company would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. In addition, our initial shareholders, officers and directors, are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. 14",

            "context": "Status as a Public Company We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our Class A ordinary shares (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our Class A ordinary shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us. Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriter\u2019s ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital, an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders\u2019 interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company\u2019s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. While we believe that our structure and our management team\u2019s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek shareholder approval of any proposed initial business combination, negatively. We are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved, If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year\u2019s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to \u201cemerging growth company\u201d shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act. Financial Position As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $109,573,279 held in the trust account, not taking into account approximately $7,336,000 of deferred underwriting fees that were waived by our underwriters. With funds available for a business combination in trust account, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third-party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us. 15",

We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering, the sale of the private placement warrants and the overfunding loans, as well as our equity, debt or a combination of these, as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. We have until September 30, 2024 (or such earlier date as our board of directors may approve in accordance with the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association) to consummate our initial business combination. However, if we cannot consummate the initial business combination by September 1, 2024 and it is reasonably determined by us and Webull that we may not be able to consummate the initial business combination by September 30, 2024, we will (a) use our reasonable best efforts to cause the our board of directors to approve such amendment to our memorandum and articles of association, as amended, to provide that the date by which we must consummate a business combination in accordance with our memorandum and articles of association, as amended, is extended from September 30, 2024 to March 31, 2025 (such period by which we must consummate a business combination, as amended, and as may be extended in accordance with the provisions of the Business Combination Agreement, the \u201cCombination Period\u201d and such proposal, the \u201cExtension Proposal\u201d) and resolve to recommend that the our shareholders approve such Extension Proposal by special resolution, which is a resolution passed by a majority of at least two-thirds of such members of the company as, being entitled to do so, vote in person or by proxy at a general meeting, and includes a unanimous written resolution (the \u201cExtension Recommendation\u201d), and not change or modify or propose to change or modify the Extension Recommendation, and (b) prepare and file with the SEC proxy statement (such proxy statement, together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the \u201cExtension Proxy Statement\u201d) for the purpose of soliciting proxies from our shareholders for the Extension Proposal, which shall include, among other things, (x) a description and introduction of Webull, and (y) a statement that the Business Combination Agreement and any other transaction documents have been entered into. We shall discuss in good faith with Webull and agree upon the terms of the Extension Proposal, including the proposed amendments to our memorandum and articles of association and additional economic incentives, if any, to be offered to our shareholders in connection with their approval of the Extension Proposal. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within the Combination Period, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account and as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. In such event, the warrants will be worthless. In addition to our sponsor\u2019s ability to extend our deadline to consummate an initial business combination by up to six months as described above, we may also hold a shareholder vote at any time to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to modify the amount of time we will have to consummate an initial business combination (as well as to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within the completion window or with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders\u2019 rights or pre-initial business combination activity). As described herein, our initial shareholders, officers and directors have agreed that they will not propose any such amendment unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then-outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post- business combination company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 16",

Sources of Target Businesses We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings.

We will also utilize our management team\u2019s operational and capital planning experience. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.

Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then-outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.25 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriter. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Further, we will not proceed with redeeming our public shares, even if a public shareholder has properly elected to redeem its shares, if a business combination does not close. Our initial shareholders, officers and directors have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by September 30, 2024 (or March 31, 2025 as may be approved as described in this Report) or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders\u2019 rights or pre-initial business combination activity. Limitations on Redemptions The proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.

In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial business combination. Limitation on Redemption Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Shareholder Approval If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, which we refer to as \u201cExcess Shares,\u201d without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder\u2019s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders\u2019 ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders\u2019 ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. Tendering Share Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights Public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d will be required to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, mailed to such holders, or to deliver their certificate(s) (if any) along with any other redemption forms to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company\u2019s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder\u2019s option, in each case up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote to approve the business combination. The proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders\u2019 vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or 24",

After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an \u201coption window\u201d after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company\u2019s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become \u201coption\u201d rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming shareholder\u2019s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved. Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, unless otherwise agreed to by us. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination. If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until September 30, 2024 (or March 31, 2025 as may be approved as described in this Report). Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business Combination Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, as amended, provide that we will have until September 30, 2024 (or March 31, 2025 as may be approved as described in this Report) to consummate a business combination. If we have not consummated an initial business combination by such date, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (less taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders\u2019 rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case, to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to consummate an initial business combination by September 30, 2024 (or March 31, 2025 as may be approved as described in this Report). Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the trust account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law. Our initial shareholders, officers and directors have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares they hold if we fail to consummate an initial business combination by September 30, 2024 (or such earlier date as our board of directors may approve in accordance with the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association), although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. 25",

This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any officer or director, or any other person. We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts held outside the trust account plus up to $100,000 of funds from the trust account available to us to pay dissolution expenses, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. As of December 31, 2023, we have approximately $163,718 in cash held outside of the trust account. If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering, the sale of the private placement warrants and the overfunding loans, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be $10.25 (assuming the period of time to consummate an initial business combination is not extended as provided for herein). The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be less than $10.25. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors\u2019 claims. Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including, but not limited, to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third-party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third-party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third-party\u2019s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third-party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. will not execute an agreement with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third-party for services rendered or products sold to us (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.25 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.25 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third-party or prospective target business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act and liabilities related to our initial business combination. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third-party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor\u2019s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 26",

While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.25 per public share. We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors, however such liability will not be greater than the amount of funds from our trust account received by any such shareholder. If we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.25 per public share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy or insolvency laws as either a \u201cpreferential transfer\u201d or a \u201cfraudulent conveyance.\u201d As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by September 30, 2024 (or March 31, 2025 as may be approved as described in this Report) (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by September 30, 2024 (or March 31, 2025 as may be approved as described in this Report) or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders\u2019 rights or pre-initial business combination activity, or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. Public shareholders who redeem their Class A ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote described in clause (ii) in the preceding sentence shall not be entitled to funds from the trust account upon the subsequent completion of an initial business combination or liquidation if we have not consummated an initial business combination by September 30, 2024 (or March 31, 2025 as may be approved as described in this Report), with respect to such Class A ordinary shares so redeemed. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder\u2019s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder\u2019s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote. 27",

            "context": "Competition In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. Facilities We currently maintain our executive offices at 228 Park Ave S #96693, New York, NY 10003. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations. Employees We currently have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Periodic Reporting and Financial Information We registered our units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, sent to shareholders. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. 28",

            "context": "29 Risks Relating to our Search for, and Consummation of or Inability to Consummate a Business Combination Our shareholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed initial business combination, which means we may complete our initial business combination even though a majority of our shareholders do not support such a combination. We may choose not to hold a shareholder vote before we complete our initial business combination if the business combination would not require shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements. For instance, if we were seeking to acquire a target business where the consideration we were paying in the transaction was all cash, we would typically not be required to seek shareholder approval to complete such a transaction. Except as required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, the decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors, such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval. Accordingly, we may complete our initial business combination even if holders of a majority of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares do not approve of the business combination we complete. Please see the section entitled \u201cBusiness-Effecting Our Initial Business Combination-Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination\u201d for additional information. If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our initial shareholders, officers and directors have agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, regardless of how our public shareholders vote. Our initial shareholders have agreed to vote all of their shares in favor of the approval for an initial business combination. As of December 31, 2023, our initial shareholders collectively owned 52.1% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares. Our initial shareholders, officers and directors also may from time to time purchase Class A ordinary shares prior to our initial business combination. As a result, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, the agreement by our initial shareholders and our officers and directors to vote in favor of our initial business combination will increase the likelihood that we will receive the requisite shareholder approval for such initial business combination. Your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash. At the time of your investment in us, you will not be provided with an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any target businesses. Since our board of directors may complete a business combination without seeking shareholder approval, public shareholders may not have the right or opportunity to vote on the business combination, unless we seek such shareholder approval. Accordingly, your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to exercising your redemption rights within the period of time (which will be at least 20 business days) set forth in our tender offer documents mailed to our public shareholders in which we describe our initial business combination. The ability of our public shareholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into a business combination with a target. We may seek to enter into a business combination transaction agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights, we would not be able to meet such closing condition and, as a result, would not be able to proceed with the business combination. Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would not allow us to satisfy a closing condition as described above, we would not proceed with such redemption and the related business combination and may instead search for an alternate business combination. Prospective targets will be aware of these risks and, thus, may be reluctant to enter into a business combination transaction with us. 30",

            "context": "The ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure. At the time we enter into an agreement for our initial business combination, we will not know how many shareholders may exercise their redemption rights, and therefore will need to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption. If a large number of shares are submitted for redemption, we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the trust account to redeem such larger number of shares or arrange for additional third-party financing. Raising additional third-party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete the most desirable business combination available to us or optimize our capital structure. The amount of the deferred underwriting commissions payable to the underwriter will not be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed in connection with an initial business combination. The per-share amount we will distribute to shareholders who properly exercise their redemption rights will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commission and after such redemptions, the amount held in trust will continue to reflect our obligation to pay the entire deferred underwriting commissions. The ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares could increase the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful and that you would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem your shares. If our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful is increased. If our initial business combination is unsuccessful, you would not receive your pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account until we liquidate the trust account. If you are in need of immediate liquidity, you could attempt to sell your shares in the open market; however, at such time our shares may trade at a discount to the pro rata amount per share in the trust account. In either situation, you may suffer a material loss on your investment or lose the benefit of funds expected in connection with our redemption until we liquidate or you are able to sell your shares in the open market. The requirement that we consummate an initial business combination within the prescribed time frame may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination and may limit the time we have in which to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets, in particular as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our initial business combination on terms that would produce value for our shareholders. Any potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning a business combination will be aware that we must consummate an initial business combination by September 30, 2024 (or March 31, 2025 as may be approved as described in this Report). Consequently, such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating a business combination, knowing that if we do not complete our initial business combination with that particular target business, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination with any target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the time frame described above. In addition, we may have limited time to conduct due diligence and may enter into our initial business combination on terms that we would have rejected upon a more comprehensive investigation. We may not be able to consummate an initial business combination within the prescribed time frame, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate. We may not be able to find a suitable target business and consummate an initial business combination with the Combination Period (as defined herein). Our ability to complete our initial business combination may be negatively impacted by general market conditions, volatility in the capital and debt markets and the other risks described herein. For example, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the recent escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict, the outbreak of COVID-19 and other events, such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters or a significant outbreak of other infectious diseases, may 31",

Similarly, other events outside of our control, including natural disasters, climate-related events, pandemics or health crisis (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) may arise from time to time. Any such events may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets, disproportionate impacts to certain industries or sectors, disruptions to commerce (including to economic activity, travel and supply chains), loss of life and property damage, and may adversely affect the global economy or capital markets, and the business of any potential target business with which we may consummate a business combination could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by these and other events, including as a result of increased market volatility, decreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all. Changes in the market for directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and complete an initial business combination. The market for directors and officers liability insurance for special purpose acquisition companies has changed in ways adverse to us and our management team. Fewer insurance companies are offering quotes for directors and officers liability coverage, the premiums charged for such policies have generally increased and the terms of such policies have generally become less favorable. There can be no assurance that these trends will not continue. The increased cost and decreased availability of directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate an initial business combination. In order to obtain directors and officers liability insurance or modify its coverage as a result of becoming a public company, the post-business combination entity might need to incur greater expense, accept less favorable terms or both. Any failure to obtain adequate directors and officers liability insurance could have an adverse impact on the post-business combination\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified officers and directors. In addition, even after we were to complete an initial business combination, our directors and officers could still be subject to potential liability from claims arising from conduct alleged to have occurred prior to the initial business combination. As a result, in order to protect our directors and officers, the post-business combination entity may need to purchase additional insurance with respect to any such claims (\u201crun-off insurance\u201d). The need for run-off insurance would be an added expense for the post-business combination entity, and could interfere with or frustrate our ability to consummate an initial business combination on terms favorable to our investors. Our sponsor controls a substantial interest in us and thus may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a shareholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support. As of December 31, 2023, our sponsor (and its transferees/designees, if any) collectively owned 51.2% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares. Accordingly, they may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a shareholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support, including amendments to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. In addition, Holdco, which is wholly owned by SK, owns a 91% economic interest in our sponsor, and therefore SK may be able to exert significant influence through our sponsor. If our sponsor purchases any additional ordinary shares in the aftermarket or in privately negotiated transactions, this would increase our sponsor\u2019s and SK\u2019s control. Neither our sponsor or its members nor, to our knowledge, any of our officers or directors, has any current intention to purchase additional securities. Factors that would be considered in making such additional purchases would include consideration of the current trading price of our ordinary shares. We may not be able to complete an initial business combination since such initial business combination may be subject to regulatory review and approval requirements, including pursuant to foreign investment regulations and review by governmental entities such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (\u201cCFIUS\u201d) or may be ultimately prohibited. Our initial business combination may be subject to regulatory review and approval requirements by governmental entities, or ultimately prohibited. For example, CFIUS has authority to review direct or indirect foreign investments in U.S. companies. Among other things, CFIUS is empowered to require certain foreign investors to make mandatory filings, to charge filing fees related to such filings, and to self-initiate national security reviews of foreign direct and 33",

In the case that CFIUS determines an investment to be a threat to national security, CFIUS has the power to unwind or place restrictions on the investment. Whether CFIUS has jurisdiction to review an acquisition or investment transaction depends on-among other factors-the nature and structure of the transaction, including the level of beneficial ownership interest and the nature of any information or governance rights involved. For example, investments that result in \u201ccontrol\u201d of a U.S. business by a foreign person always are subject to CFIUS jurisdiction. CFIUS\u2019s expanded jurisdiction under the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 and implementing regulations that became effective on February 13, 2020 further includes investments that do not result in control of a U.S. business by a foreign person but afford certain foreign investors certain information or governance rights in a U.S. business that has a nexus to \u201ccritical technologies,\u201d \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d and/or \u201csensitive personal data.\u201d For so long as SK retains a material ownership interest in us, we may be deemed a \u201cforeign person\u201d under the regulations relating to CFIUS. As such, an initial business combination with a U.S. business or foreign business with U.S. subsidiaries that we may wish to pursue may be subject to CFIUS review. If a particular proposed initial business combination with a U.S. business falls within CFIUS\u2019s jurisdiction, we may determine that we are required to make a mandatory filing or that we will submit to CFIUS review on a voluntary basis, or to proceed with the transaction without submitting to CFIUS and risk CFIUS intervention, before or after closing the transaction. CFIUS may decide to block or delay our proposed initial business combination, impose conditions with respect to such initial business combination or request the President of the United States to order us to divest all or a portion of the U.S. target business of our initial business combination that we acquired without first obtaining CFIUS approval, which may limit the attractiveness of, delay or prevent us from pursuing certain target companies that we believe would otherwise be beneficial to us and our shareholders. In addition, certain federally licensed businesses may be subject to rules or regulations that limit foreign ownership. The process of government review, whether by CFIUS or otherwise, could be lengthy. Because we have only a limited time to complete our initial business combination, our failure to obtain any required approvals within the requisite time period may require us to liquidate. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within the applicable time period required under our amended and restated memorandum and certificate of incorporation, including as a result of extended regulatory review of a potential initial business combination, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account and as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. In such event, our shareholders will miss the opportunity to benefit from an investment in a target company and the appreciation in value of such investment. Additionally, the warrants will be worthless. If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our initial shareholders, directors, officers, advisors and their affiliates may elect to purchase public shares or warrants, which may influence a vote on a proposed business combination and reduce the public \u201cfloat\u201d of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants. If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our initial shareholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market prior to the completion of our initial business combination where otherwise permissible under applicable law, rules and regulations, although they are under no obligation to do so. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares or warrants in such transactions. In the event that our initial shareholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. The purpose of any such purchase of public shares or warrants could be to (1) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination or (2) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. 34",

Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. See \u201cBusiness-Effecting Our Initial Business Combination-Permitted Purchases and Other Transactions with Respect to Our Securities\u201d for a description of how our initial shareholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase securities from in any private transaction. If a shareholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with our initial business combination, or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed. We will comply with the proxy rules or tender offer rules, as applicable, when conducting redemptions in connection with our initial business combination. Despite our compliance with these rules, if a shareholder fails to receive our proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, such shareholder may not become aware of the opportunity to redeem its shares. In addition, the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will describe the various procedures that must be complied with in order to validly redeem or tender public shares. In the event that a shareholder fails to comply with these procedures, its shares may not be redeemed. See \u201cBusiness-Effecting Our Initial Business Combination-Tendering Share Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights.\u201d As the number of special purpose acquisition companies evaluating targets increases, attractive targets may become scarcer and there may be more competition for attractive targets. This could increase the cost of our initial business combination and could even result in our inability to find a target or to consummate an initial business combination. In recent years, the number of special purpose acquisition companies that have been formed has increased substantially. Many potential targets for special purpose acquisition companies have already entered into an initial business combination, and there are still many special purpose acquisition companies preparing for an initial public offering, as well as many such companies currently in registration. As a result, at times, fewer attractive targets may be available to consummate an initial business combination. In addition, because there are more special purpose acquisition companies seeking to enter into an initial business combination with available targets, the competition for available targets with attractive fundamentals or business models may increase, which could cause targets companies to demand improved financial terms. Attractive deals could also become scarcer for other reasons, such as economic or industry sector downturns, geopolitical tensions, or increases in the cost of additional capital needed to close business combinations or operate targets post-business combination. This could increase the cost of, delay or otherwise complicate or frustrate our ability to find and consummate an initial business combination, and may result in our inability to consummate an initial business combination on terms favorable to our investors altogether. We may seek acquisition opportunities with an early stage company, a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of revenue or earnings. To the extent we complete our initial business combination with an early stage company, a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the operations of the business with which we combine. These risks include investing in a business without a proven business model and with limited historical financial data, volatile revenues or earnings, intense competition and difficulties in obtaining and retaining key personnel. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not be able to properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors and we may not have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. 35",

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, which we refer to as the \u201cExcess Shares,\u201d without our prior consent. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders\u2019 ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. Your inability to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce your influence over our ability to complete our initial business combination and you could suffer a material loss on your investment in us if you sell Excess Shares in open market transactions. Additionally, you will not receive redemption distributions with respect to the Excess Shares if we complete our initial business combination. And as a result, you will continue to hold that number of shares exceeding 15% and, in order to dispose of such shares, would be required to sell your shares in open market transactions, potentially at a loss. Because of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.25 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering, the sale of the private placement warrants and the overfunding loans, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, we are obligated to offer holders of our public shares the right to redeem their shares for cash at the time of our initial business combination in conjunction with a shareholder vote or via a tender offer. Potential target companies will be aware that this may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.25 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. See \u201c -If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.25 per public share\u201d and other risk factors herein.

The funds available to us outside of the trust account may not be sufficient to allow us to operate by September 30, 2024 (or March 31, 2025 as may be approved as described in this Report), assuming that our initial business combination is not completed during that time.

Any such event in the future may negatively impact the analysis regarding our ability to continue as a going concern at such time. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $163,718 in cash and working capital deficit of approximately $6.6 million. If we are required to seek additional capital, we would need to borrow funds from our sponsor, its affiliates, members of our management team or other third parties to operate or may be forced to liquidate. Neither our sponsor, members of our management team nor their affiliates is under any obligation to us in such circumstances. Any such advances may be repaid only from funds held outside the trust account or from funds released to us upon completion of our initial business combination. Up to $1,500,000 of such working capital loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor, its affiliates or members of our management team as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. Consequently, our public shareholders may only receive an estimated $10.25 per public share, or possibly less, on our redemption of our public shares, and our warrants will expire worthless. See \u201c -If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.25 per public share\u201d and other risk factors herein. Our management has determined that the liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation, should a business combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Our management plans to address this uncertainty through the completion of the initial business combination. However, there is no assurance that our plans to consummate the initial business combination will be successful or successful within the combination period. Subsequent to our completion of our initial business combination, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and the price of our securities, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment. Even if we conduct extensive due diligence on a target business with which we combine, we cannot assure you that this diligence will identify all material issues with a particular target business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining post-combination debt financing. Accordingly, any holders who choose to retain their securities following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value. 37",

Our placing of funds in the trust account may not protect those funds from third-party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if they execute such agreements, they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third-party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third-party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third-party\u2019s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third-party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we have not consummated an initial business combination by September 30, 2024 (or March 31, 2025 as may be approved as described in this Report), or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the ten years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders could be less than the $10.25 per public share initially held in the trust account, due to claims of such creditors. Pursuant to the letter agreement with our initial shareholders, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third-party (other than our independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.25 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.25 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third-party or prospective target business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act and liabilities related to our initial business combination. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third-party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor\u2019s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.25 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. Our directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public shareholders. In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.25 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.25 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment and subject to their fiduciary duties may choose not to do so in any particular instance. If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public shareholders may be reduced below $10.25 per public share. 38",

We have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law.

Accordingly, any indemnification provided will be able to be satisfied by us only if (i) we have sufficient funds outside of the trust account or (ii) we consummate an initial business combination. Our obligation to indemnify our officers and directors may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against our officers or directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against our officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our shareholders. Furthermore, a shareholder\u2019s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against our officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions. The securities in which we invest the funds held in the trust account could bear a negative rate of interest, which could reduce the value of the assets held in trust such that the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders may be less than $10.25 per share. The proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. While short-term U.S. government treasury obligations currently yield a positive rate of interest, they have briefly yielded negative interest rates in recent years. Central banks in Europe and Japan pursued interest rates below zero in recent years, and the Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve has not ruled out the possibility that it may in the future adopt similar policies in the United States. In the event that we do not to complete our initial business combination or make certain amendments to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, our public shareholders are entitled to receive their pro-rata share of the proceeds held in the trust account, plus any interest income earned thereon (less taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest income to pay dissolution expenses). Negative interest rates could reduce the value of the assets held in trust such that the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders may be less than $10.25 per share. If, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy or insolvency court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our board of directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of our board of directors and us to claims of punitive damages. If, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy or insolvency laws as either a \u201cpreferential transfer\u201d or a \u201cfraudulent conveyance.\u201d As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. If, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of our shareholders and the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our shareholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced. If, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our shareholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced. 39",

We are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we are required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements, our business combination may be contingent on our ability to comply with certain laws and regulations and any post-business combination company may be subject to additional laws and regulations. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. A failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial Business Combination, and results of operations. In addition, those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may change from time to time, including as a result of changes in economic, political, social and government policies, and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial Business Combination, and results of operations. On January 24, 2024, the SEC adopted new rules and amendments that would, among other items, impose additional disclosure requirements in initial public offerings by SPACs and business combination transactions involving SPACs and private operating companies; enhanced disclosures about conflicts of interest, SPAC sponsor compensation, dilution, and other information that is important to investors, disclosure requirements related to projections, including disclosure of all material bases of the projections and all material assumptions underlying the projections. These rules, once effective, may materially adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination and may increase the costs and time related thereto. If we have not consummated an initial business combination by September 30, 2024 (or March 31, 2025 as may be approved in accordance with an amended and restated memorandum and articles of association), our public shareholders may be forced to wait beyond such period before redemption from our trust account. If we have not consummated an initial business combination by September 30, 2024 (or March 31, 2025 as may be approved in accordance with an amended and restated memorandum and articles of association), the proceeds then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (less taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), will be used to fund the redemption of our public shares, as further described herein. Any redemption of public shareholders from the trust account will be effected automatically by function of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association prior to any voluntary winding up. If we are required to wind up, liquidate the trust account and distribute such amount therein, pro rata, to our public shareholders, as part of any liquidation process, such winding up, liquidation and distribution must comply with the applicable provisions of the Companies Act. In that case, investors may be forced to wait beyond September 30, 2024 (or March 31, 2025 as may be approved as described in this Report) before the redemption proceeds of our trust account become available to them, and they receive the return of their pro rata portion of the proceeds from our trust account. We have no obligation to return funds to investors prior to the date of our redemption or liquidation unless, prior thereto, we consummate our initial business combination or amend certain provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, and only then in cases where investors have sought to redeem their Class A ordinary shares. Only upon our redemption or any liquidation will public shareholders be entitled to distributions if we do not complete our initial business combination and do not amend certain provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the trust account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law. Our shareholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares. In certain circumstances, including if we are forced to enter into an insolvent liquidation, any distributions received by shareholders could be challenged if it was proved that immediately following the date on which the distribution was made, we were insolvent or otherwise that the distribution was made to defraud creditors. As a result, a liquidator or creditor could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to us or our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing themselves and our company to claims, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. We and our directors and officers who knowingly and willfully authorized or permitted any distribution to be paid out while we were insolvent would be guilty of an offence and may be liable for a fine and/or a period of imprisonment in the Cayman Islands. 41",

In accordance with the Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual general meeting until one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on the Nasdaq. There is no requirement under the Companies Act for us to hold annual or extraordinary general meetings to elect directors. Until we hold an annual general meeting, public shareholders may not be afforded the opportunity to appoint directors and to discuss company affairs with management. Our board of directors is divided into three classes with only one class of directors being appointed in each year and each class (except for those directors appointed prior to our first annual general meeting) serving a three-year term. You will not be permitted to exercise your warrants unless we register and qualify the underlying Class A ordinary shares or certain exemptions are available. If the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act, we will be required to permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, in which case, the number of Class A ordinary shares that you will receive upon cashless exercise will be based on a formula. However, no warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration is available. Notwithstanding the above, if our Class A ordinary shares are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a \u201ccovered security\u201d under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders of public warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a \u201ccashless basis\u201d in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event we so elect, we will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. Exercising the warrants on a cashless basis could have the effect of reducing the potential \u201cupside\u201d of the holder\u2019s investment in our company because the warrant holder will hold a smaller number of Class A ordinary shares upon a cashless exercise of the warrants they hold. In no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant, or issue securities or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under applicable state securities laws and no exemption is available. If the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or qualified or exempt from registration or qualification, the holder of such warrant shall not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of units will have paid the full unit purchase price solely for the Class A ordinary shares included in the units. There may be a circumstance where an exemption from registration exists for holders of our private placement warrants to exercise their warrants while a corresponding exemption does not exist for holders of the public warrants included as part of units sold in our initial public offering. In such an instance, our sponsor and its permitted transferees (which may include our directors and officers) would be able to exercise their warrants and sell the ordinary shares underlying their warrants while holders of our public warrants would not be able to exercise their warrants and sell the underlying ordinary shares. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying Class A ordinary shares for sale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, we may redeem the warrants as set forth above even if the holders are otherwise unable to exercise their warrants. The warrants may become exercisable and redeemable for a security other than the Class A ordinary shares, and you will not have any information regarding such other security at this time. In certain situations, including if we are not the surviving entity in our initial business combination, the warrants may become exercisable for a security other than the Class A ordinary shares. As a result, if the surviving company redeems your warrants for securities pursuant to the warrant agreement, you may receive a security in a company of which you do not have information at this time. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, the surviving company will be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to register the issuance of the security underlying the warrants within twenty business days of the closing of an initial business combination. 42",

Pursuant to an agreement entered into prior to the closing of our initial public offering, our initial shareholders and their permitted transferees can demand that we register the resale of the Class A ordinary shares into which founder shares are convertible and the private placement warrants and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants, warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans and extension loans and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of such warrants and any Class A ordinary shares issued to our sponsor upon conversion of the overfunding loans. We will bear the cost of registering these securities. The registration and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A ordinary shares. In addition, the existence of the registration rights may make our initial business combination more costly or difficult to conclude. This is because the shareholders of the target business may increase the equity stake they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on the market price of our securities that is expected when the securities owned by our initial shareholders or their permitted transferees are registered for resale. We may have a limited ability to assess the management of a prospective target business and, as a result, may affect our initial business combination with a target business whose management may not have the skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. When evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with a prospective target business, our ability to assess the target business\u2019s management may be limited due to a lack of time, resources or information. Our assessment of the capabilities of the target business\u2019s management, therefore, may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities we suspected. Should the target business\u2019s management not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to manage a public company, the operations and profitability of the post-combination business may be negatively impacted. Accordingly, any holders who choose to retain their securities following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value. The officers and directors of an acquisition candidate may resign upon completion of our initial business combination. The loss of a business combination target\u2019s key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. The role of an acquisition candidate\u2019s key personnel upon the completion of our initial business combination cannot be ascertained at this time. Although we contemplate that certain members of an acquisition candidate\u2019s management team will remain associated with the acquisition candidate following our initial business combination, it is possible that members of the management of an acquisition candidate will not wish to remain in place. We may seek acquisition opportunities in industries or sectors which may or may not be outside of our management\u2019s area of expertise. We will consider a business combination outside of our management\u2019s area of expertise if a business combination target is presented to us and we determine that such candidate offers an attractive acquisition opportunity for our company. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular business combination target, we cannot assure you that we will adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will not ultimately prove to be less favorable to investors in our initial public offering than a direct investment, if an opportunity were available, in a business combination target. In the event we elect to pursue an acquisition outside of the areas of our management\u2019s expertise, our management\u2019s expertise may not be directly applicable to its evaluation or operation, and the information contained in this Report regarding the areas of our management\u2019s expertise would not be relevant to an understanding of the business that we elect to acquire. As a result, our management may not be able to adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. Accordingly, any holders who choose to retain their securities following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value. 43",

Although we have identified general criteria and guidelines for evaluating prospective target businesses, it is possible that a target business with which we enter into our initial business combination will not have all of these positive attributes. If we complete our initial business combination with Webull, which may not meet some or all of these guidelines, such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a business that does meet all of our general criteria and guidelines. In addition, if we announce a prospective business combination with a target that does not meet our general criteria and guidelines, a greater number of shareholders may exercise their redemption rights, which may make it difficult for us to meet any closing condition with a target business that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. In addition, if shareholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, it may be more difficult for us to attain shareholder approval of our initial business combination if the target business does not meet our general criteria and guidelines. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.25 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. We are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent accounting or investment banking firm, and consequently, you may have no assurance from an independent source that the price we are paying for the business is fair to our shareholders from a financial point of view. Unless we complete our initial business combination with an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions that the price we are paying is fair to our shareholders from a financial point of view. If no opinion is obtained, our shareholders will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors, who will determine fair market value based on standards generally accepted by the financial community. Such standards used will be disclosed in our proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, related to our initial business combination. We may issue additional Class A ordinary shares or preference shares to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial business combination. We may also issue Class A ordinary shares upon the conversion of the founder shares at a ratio greater than one-to-one at the time of our initial business combination as a result of the anti-dilution provisions contained in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. Any such issuances would dilute the interest of our shareholders and likely present other risks. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association authorize the issuance of up to 9,000,000,000 Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, 999,000,000 Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, and 990,000 preference shares, par value $0.0001 per share. Immediately after our initial public offering and the partial exercise of the underwriter\u2019s Over-Allotment Option, there were 8,979,040,000 and 993,760,000 authorized but unissued Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares, respectively, available for issuance which amount does not take into account shares reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants or shares issuable upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares, if any. The Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares (which such Class A ordinary shares delivered upon conversion will not have any redemption rights or be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account if we fail to consummate an initial business combination) at the time of our initial business combination or earlier at the option of the holders thereof as described herein and in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. Immediately after our initial public offering and the partial exercise of the underwriter\u2019s Over-Allotment Option, there were no preference shares issued and outstanding.

We may be forced to close the Business Combination with Webull even if it determines it is no longer in our shareholders\u2019 best interest. Public shareholders are protected from a material adverse event of Webull arising between the date of the Business Combination Agreement and the date of the extraordinary general meeting, primarily by the right to redeem their public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in our trust account, calculated as of two (2) business days prior to the consummation of the Business Combination. If a material adverse event were to occur after approval at the extraordinary general meeting, we may be forced to close the Business Combination even if we determine that it is no longer in our shareholders\u2019 best interest to do so (as a result of such material adverse event), which could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Risks Relating to Our Securities The value of the founder shares following completion of our initial business combination is likely to be substantially higher than the nominal price paid for them, even if the trading price of our ordinary shares at such time is substantially less than $10.00 per share. Upon the closing of our initial public offering and the partial exercise of the underwriter\u2019s Over-Allotment Option, our initial shareholders invested in us an aggregate of $6,817,000, comprised of the $25,000 purchase price for the founder shares and the $6,792,000 purchase price for the private placement warrants. Such purchase of the private placement warrants was funded by SK, an affiliate of our sponsor. Assuming a trading price of $10.00 per share upon consummation of our initial business combination, the 5,240,000 founder shares would have an aggregate implied value of $52,400,000. Even if the trading price of our ordinary shares were as low as $1.30 per share, and the private placement warrants are worthless, the value of the founder shares would be approximately equal to the initials shareholders\u2019 initial investment in us. As a result, our initial shareholders are likely to be able to make a substantial profit on the investment in us at a time when our public shares have lost significant value (whether because of a substantial amount of redemptions of our public shares or any other reason). Accordingly, our management team, which owns interests in our sponsor, may be more willing to pursue a business combination with a riskier or less-established target business than would be the case if our sponsor had paid the same per share price for the founder shares as our public shareholders paid for their public shares. The nominal purchase price paid by our initial shareholders for the founder shares may significantly dilute the implied value of your public shares in the event we consummate an initial business combination, and our initial shareholders likely to make a substantial profit on their investment in us in the event we consummate an initial business combination, even if the business combination causes the trading price of our ordinary shares to materially decline. While we offered our units at an offering price of $10.00 per unit and the amount in our trust account was initially $10.25 per public share, implying an initial value of $10.25 per public share, our initial shareholders paid only a nominal aggregate purchase price of $25,000 for the founder shares, or approximately $0.005 per share. As a result, the value of your public shares may be significantly diluted in the event we consummate an initial business combination. Note that redemptions of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination would further reduce the implied value of our Class A ordinary shares. Therefore, even if the trading price of our ordinary shares significantly declines (whether because of a substantial amount of redemptions of our public shares or for any other reason), our initial shareholders will stand to make significant profit on its investment in us. As a result, our initial shareholders are likely to make a substantial profit on its investment in us even if we select and consummate an initial business combination that causes the trading price of our Class A ordinary shares to decline, while our public shareholders who purchased our securities could lose significant value in their public shares. Our initial shareholders may therefore be economically incentivized to consummate an initial business combination with a riskier, weaker-performing or less-established target business than would be the case if our initial shareholders had paid the same per share price for the founder shares as our public shareholders paid for their public shares. 47",

Our PFIC status for our current and subsequent taxable years may depend on the PFIC status of a company with which we combine, such as Webull pursuant to a business combination. Accordingly, there can be no assurances with respect to our status as a PFIC for our current taxable year or any subsequent taxable year. Our actual PFIC status for any taxable year, however, will not be determinable until after the end of such taxable year. Moreover, if we determine we are a PFIC for any taxable year, we will endeavor to provide to a U.S. Holder such information as the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) may require, including a PFIC Annual Information Statement in order to enable the U.S. Holder to make and maintain a \u201cqualified electing fund\u201d election, but there can be no assurance that we will timely provide such required information or that the company with which we combine will timely provide such required information., and such election would likely be unavailable with respect to our warrants in all cases. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the possible application of the PFIC rules. An investment in our units may result in uncertain U.S. federal income tax consequences. An investment in our units may result in uncertain U.S. federal income tax consequences. For instance, because there are no authorities that directly address instruments similar to our units, the allocation an investor makes with respect to the purchase price of a unit between the underlying Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant included in each unit could be challenged by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) or courts. Furthermore, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of a cashless exercise of our warrants is unclear under current law. Finally, it is unclear whether the redemption rights with respect to our Class A ordinary shares suspend the running of a U.S. Holder\u2019s holding period for purposes of determining whether any gain or loss realized by such holder on the sale or exchange of Class A ordinary shares is long-term capital gain or loss and for determining whether any dividends we pay would be considered \u201cqualified dividends\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisers with respect to the tax consequences of owning and disposing of our securities. Our initial business combination or transactions relating thereto may result in taxes imposed on us and our shareholders or warrant holders. We may, in connection with our initial business combination and subject to requisite shareholder approval by special resolution under the Companies Act (which is a resolution passed by a majority of at least two-thirds of such members of the company as, being entitled to do so, vote in person or by proxy at a general meeting of the company, and includes a unanimous written resolution), merge or otherwise combine with another company such as Webull, or reincorporate in or transfer by way of continuation to the jurisdiction in which the target company or business is located or another jurisdiction. Tax structuring considerations are complex, the relevant facts and law are uncertain and may change, and we may prioritize commercial and other considerations over tax considerations. A shareholder or warrant holder may be required to recognize taxable income or gain with respect to our business combination or transactions relating thereto in the jurisdiction in which the shareholder or warrant holder is a tax resident (or in which its members are resident if it is a tax transparent entity), in which the target company, such as Webull, is located, or in which we reincorporate. In the event of a reincorporation, transfer by way of continuation or merger, any tax liability may attach prior to any consummation of redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares. We do not intend to make any cash distributions to shareholders or warrant holders to pay taxes in connection with our business combination or thereafter. Shareholders and warrant holders may be subject to withholding taxes or other taxes with respect to their ownership of us after our business combination. In addition, we could be treated as tax resident in the jurisdiction in which the target company or business is located, which could result in adverse tax consequences to us (e.g., taxation on our worldwide income in such jurisdiction) and to our shareholders or warrant holders (e.g., withholding taxes on dividends and taxation of disposition gains). 48",

If we effect such a business combination, we could be subject to significant income, withholding and other tax obligations in a number of jurisdictions with respect to income, operations and subsidiaries related to those jurisdictions. Due to the complexity of tax obligations and filings in other jurisdictions, we may have a heightened risk related to audits or examinations by taxing authorities. This additional complexity and risk could have an adverse effect on our after-tax profitability and financial condition. After our initial business combination, it is possible that a majority of our directors and officers will live outside the United States and all of our assets will be located outside the United States; therefore investors may not be able to enforce federal securities laws or their other legal rights. It is possible that after our initial business combination, a majority of our directors and officers will reside outside of the United States and all of our assets will be located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult, or in some cases not possible, for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights, to effect service of process upon all of our directors or officers or to enforce judgments of United States courts predicated upon civil liabilities and criminal penalties on our directors and officers under United States laws. We are dependent upon our officers and directors and their loss could adversely affect our ability to operate. Our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of individuals and, in particular, our officers and directors. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our officers and directors, at least until we have completed our initial business combination. In addition, our officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating their time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. We do not have an employment agreement with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any of our directors or officers. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our directors or officers could have a detrimental effect on us. Our ability to successfully effect our initial business combination and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, some of whom may join us following our initial business combination. The loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. Our ability to successfully effect our initial business combination is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. The role of our key personnel in the target business, however, cannot presently be ascertained. Although some of our key personnel may remain with the target business in senior management, director or advisory positions following our initial business combination, it is likely that some or all of the management of the target business will remain in place. While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after our initial business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a company regulated by the SEC, which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements. Our key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business combination, and a particular business combination may be conditioned on the retention or resignation of such key personnel. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following our initial business combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous. Our key personnel may be able to remain with our company after the completion of our initial business combination only if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for such individuals to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to us after the completion of the business combination. Such negotiations also could make such key personnel\u2019s retention or resignation a condition to any such agreement. The personal and financial interests of such individuals may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business. In addition, pursuant to an 49",

However, we might not ultimately be successful in any claim we may make against them for such reason. We may engage in a business combination with one or more target businesses that have relationships with entities that may be affiliated with our sponsor, officers, directors or initial shareholders which may raise potential conflicts of interest. In light of the involvement of our sponsor, officers and directors with other entities, we may decide to acquire one or more businesses affiliated with our sponsor, officers, directors or initial shareholders. Our directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities, including, without limitation, those described under \u201cDirectors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance -Conflicts of Interest.\u201d SK, our sponsor, officers and directors may sponsor, form or participate in other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Such entities may compete with us for business combination opportunities. Our sponsor, officers and directors are not currently aware of any specific opportunities for us to complete our initial business combination with any entities with which they are affiliated, and there have been no substantive discussions concerning a business combination with any such entity or entities. Although we will not be specifically focusing on, or targeting, any transaction with any affiliated entities, we would pursue such a transaction if we determined that such affiliated entity met our criteria and guidelines for a business combination as set forth in \u201cBusiness-Effecting Our Initial Business Combination-Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination\u201d and such transaction was approved by a majority of our independent and disinterested directors. Despite our agreement to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions regarding the fairness to our shareholders from a financial point of view of a business combination with one or more domestic or international businesses affiliated with our sponsor, officers, directors or initial shareholders, potential conflicts of interest still may exist and, as a result, the terms of the business combination may not be as advantageous to our public shareholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest. Since our initial shareholders, officers and directors will lose their entire investment in us if our initial business combination is not completed (other than with respect to public shares they may acquire during or after our initial public offering), a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business combination. On December 9, 2021, our sponsor paid $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share, to cover certain of our expenses in consideration of 8,625,000 Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001. On February 24, 2022, 1,437,500 Class B ordinary shares were surrendered and thereupon cancelled by the company resulting in a decrease in the total number of Class B ordinary shares outstanding from 8,625,000 shares to 7,187,500 shares. On May 5, 2022, 1,437,500 Class B ordinary shares were surrendered and thereupon cancelled by the company resulting in a decrease in the total number of Class B ordinary shares outstanding from 7,187,500 shares to 5,750,000 shares. Prior to the completion of our initial public offering, our sponsor transferred an aggregate of 90,000 Class B ordinary shares to our independent director nominees. Prior to the initial investment in the company of $25,000 by the sponsor, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible. The per share price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount contributed to the company by the number of founder shares issued. The founder shares will be worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination. In addition, our sponsor has purchased an aggregate of 6,792,000 private placement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share, at a price of $1.00 per warrant, or $6,792,000 in the aggregate, in a private placement that closed simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering and the partial exercise of the underwriter\u2019s over-allotment option. Such purchase was funded by SK, an affiliate of our sponsor. If we do not consummate an initial business by September 30, 2024 (or March 31, 2025 as may be 51",

With multiple business combinations, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business. If we are unable to adequately address these risks, it could negatively impact our profitability and results of operations. We may attempt to complete our initial business combination with a private company about which little information is available, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all. In pursuing our acquisition strategy, we may seek to effectuate our initial business combination with a privately held company. Very little public information generally exists about private companies, and we could be required to make our decision on whether to pursue a potential initial business combination on the basis of limited information, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all. Our management may not be able to maintain control of a target business after our initial business combination. Upon the loss of control of a target business, new management may not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business. We may structure our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction that does not meet such criteria. Even if the post-business combination company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new Class A ordinary shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new Class A ordinary shares, our shareholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding Class A ordinary shares subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority shareholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company\u2019s shares than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain control of the target business. We may seek business combination opportunities with a high degree of complexity that require significant operational improvements, which could delay or prevent us from achieving our desired results. We may seek business combination opportunities with large, highly complex companies that we believe would benefit from operational improvements. While we intend to implement such improvements, to the extent that our efforts are delayed or we are unable to achieve the desired improvements, the business combination may not be as successful as we anticipate. To the extent we complete our initial business combination with a large complex business or entity with a complex operating structure, we may also be affected by numerous risks inherent in the operations of the business with which we combine, which could delay or prevent us from implementing our strategy. Although our management team will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business and its operations, we may not be able to properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors until we complete our business combination. If we are not able to achieve our desired operational improvements, or the improvements take longer to implement than anticipated, we may not achieve the gains that we anticipate. Furthermore, some of these risks and complexities may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks and complexities will adversely impact a target business. Such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a smaller, less complex organization. 54",

In addition, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will require us to provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash if we propose an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by September 30, 2024 (or March 31, 2025 as may be approved as described in this Report) or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders\u2019 rights or pre-initial business combination activity.

The provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that relate to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares may be amended with the approval of a special resolution which requires the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of our ordinary shares who attend, either in person or by proxy, and vote at a general meeting of the company, which is a lower amendment threshold than that of some other blank check companies. It may be easier for us, therefore, to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to facilitate the completion of an initial business combination that some of our shareholders may not support.

Although we believe that the net proceeds of our initial public offering, the sale of the private placement warrants and the overfunding loans will be sufficient to allow us to complete our initial business combination, because we have not yet selected any prospective target business we cannot ascertain the capital requirements for any particular transaction. If the net proceeds of our initial public offering, the sale of the private placement warrants and the overfunding loans prove to be insufficient, either because of the size of our initial business combination, the depletion of the available net proceeds in search of a target business, the obligation to redeem for cash a significant number of shares from shareholders who elect redemption in connection with our initial business combination or the terms of negotiated transactions to purchase shares in connection with our initial business combination, we may be required to seek additional financing or to abandon the proposed business combination. We cannot assure you that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The current economic environment may make it difficult for companies to obtain acquisition financing. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to complete our initial business combination, we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.25 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. In addition, even if we do not need additional financing to complete our initial business combination, we may require such financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business.

As a result, the exercise price of your warrants could be increased, the exercise period could be shortened and the number of our Class A ordinary shares purchasable upon exercise of a warrant could be decreased, all without your approval. Our warrants are issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder for the purpose of (i) curing any ambiguity or correct any mistake, including to conform the provisions of the warrant agreement to the description of the terms of the warrants and the warrant agreement set forth in our final prospectus in connection with our initial public offering, or defective provision (ii) amending the provisions relating to cash dividends on ordinary shares as contemplated by and in accordance with the warrant agreement, (iii) adding or changing any provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the warrant agreement as the parties to the warrant agreement may deem necessary or desirable and that the parties deem to not adversely affect the rights of the registered holders of the warrants provided that the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then-outstanding public warrants is required to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of public warrants. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the public warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 50% of the then-outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment and, solely with respect to any amendment to the terms of the private placement warrants or any provision of the warrant agreement with respect to the private placement warrants, 50% of the number of the then outstanding private placement warrants. Although our ability to amend the terms of the public warrants with the consent of at least 50% of the then-outstanding public warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, convert the warrants into cash, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of Class A ordinary shares purchasable upon exercise of a warrant. 57",

Our warrant agreement provides that, subject to applicable law, (i) any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the warrant agreement, including under the Securities Act, will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and (ii) that we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim. We will waive any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and that such courts represent an inconvenient forum. With respect to any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, we note, however, that there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce this provision and that investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for state and federal courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, these provisions of the warrant agreement will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our warrants shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions in our warrant agreement. If any action, the subject matter of which is within the scope the forum provisions of the warrant agreement, is filed in a court other than a court of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (a \u201cforeign action\u201d) in the name of any holder of our warrants, such holder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of New York in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (an \u201cenforcement action\u201d), and (y) having service of process made upon such warrant holder in any such enforcement action by service upon such warrant holder\u2019s counsel in the foreign action as agent for such warrant holder. This choice-of-forum provision may limit a warrant holder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with our company, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our warrant agreement inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors. We may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless. We have the ability to redeem the outstanding public warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, provided that the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to proper notice of such redemption and provided that certain other conditions are met. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, we may redeem the warrants as set forth above even if the holders are otherwise unable to exercise the warrants. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you to (i) exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (iii) accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, we expect would be substantially less than the market value of your warrants. None of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us. Our warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A ordinary shares and make it more difficult to effectuate our initial business combination. We issued warrants to purchase 10,480,000 of our Class A ordinary shares as part of the units offered in our initial public offering, including as a result of the partial exercise of the underwriter\u2019s Over-Allotment Option. Simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering and the partial exercise of the underwriter\u2019s Over-Allotment Option, we issued in a private placement an aggregate of 6,792,000, at a price of $1.00 per warrant. Such purchase was funded by SK, an affiliate of our sponsor. In addition, if the sponsor, its affiliates or a member of our management team makes any working capital loans, it may convert up to $1,500,000 of such working capital loans into up to an additional 1,500,000 private placement warrants, at the price of $1.00 per warrant. We may also issue Class A ordinary shares in connection with our redemption of our warrants. 58",

            "context": "To the extent we issue ordinary shares for any reason, including to effectuate a business combination, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional Class A ordinary shares upon exercise of these warrants could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business. Such warrants, when exercised, will increase the number of issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares and reduce the value of the Class A ordinary shares issued to complete the business transaction. Therefore, our warrants may make it more difficult to effectuate a business transaction or increase the cost of acquiring the target business. Because each unit contains one-half of one redeemable warrant and only a whole warrant may be exercised, the units may be worth less than units of other blank check companies. Each unit contains one-half of one redeemable warrant. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, no fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units, and only whole units will trade. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number the number of Class A ordinary shares to be issued to the warrant holder. This is different from other offerings similar to ours whose units include one ordinary share and one whole warrant to purchase one whole share. We have established the components of the units in this way in order to reduce the dilutive effect of the warrants upon completion of a business combination since the warrants will be exercisable in the aggregate for one-half of the number of shares compared to units that each contain a whole warrant to purchase one whole share, thus making us, we believe, a more attractive merger partner for target businesses. Nevertheless, this unit structure may cause our units to be worth less than if a unit included a warrant to purchase one whole share. A provision of our warrant agreement may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination. Unlike most blank check companies, if (i) we issue additional Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of our initial business combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per ordinary share (with such issue price or shares held by our sponsor or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the \u201cNewly Issued Price\u201d), (ii) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of our initial business combination on the date of the consummation of our initial business combination (net of redemptions), and (iii) the volume weighted average trading price of our Class A ordinary shares during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which we consummate our initial business combination (such price, the \u201cMarket Value\u201d) is below $9.20 per share, then the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the $18.00 per share redemption trigger prices will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price. This may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination with a target business. 59",

Furthermore, an active trading market for our securities may never develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established and sustained. Because we must furnish our shareholders with target business financial statements, we may lose the ability to complete an otherwise advantageous initial business combination with some prospective target businesses. The federal proxy rules require that a proxy statement with respect to a vote on a business combination meeting certain financial significance tests include historical and/or pro forma financial statement disclosure in periodic reports. We will include the same financial statement disclosure in connection with our tender offer documents, whether or not they are required under the tender offer rules. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, or international financial reporting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. General Risk Factors We have no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.

If the company is unable to raise additional funds to alleviate liquidity needs and complete a business combination by September 30, 2024 (or March 31, 2025 as may be approved as described in this Report), then the company will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating.

Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of covered securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies, other than the State of Idaho, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if we were no longer listed on the Nasdaq, our securities would not qualify as covered securities under the statute and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. You will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies. Since the net proceeds of our initial public offering, the sale of the private placement warrants and the overfunding loans are intended to be used to complete an initial business combination with a target business that has not been selected, we may be deemed to be a \u201cblank check\u201d company under the United States securities laws. However, because we had net tangible assets in excess of $5,000,000 upon the completion of our initial public offering, the sale of the private placement warrants and the overfunding loans and we filed a Current Report on Form 8-K, including an audited balance sheet demonstrating this fact, we are exempt from rules promulgated by the SEC to protect investors in blank check companies, such as Rule 419. Accordingly, investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules. Among other things, this means our units were immediately tradable and we have a longer period of time to complete our initial business combination than do companies subject to Rule 419. Moreover, if our initial public offering were subject to Rule 419, that rule would prohibit the release of any interest earned on funds held in the trust account to us unless and until the funds in the trust account were released to us in connection with our completion of an initial business combination. We are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d or \u201csmaller reporting companies,\u201d this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies. We are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our shareholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our Class A ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile. Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. 62",

We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible. Compliance obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may make it more difficult for us to effectuate a business combination, require substantial financial and management resources, and increase the time and costs of completing an acquisition. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. The fact that we are a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome on us as compared to other public companies because a target business with which we seek to complete our initial business combination may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of the internal control of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. Provisions in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our Class A ordinary shares and could entrench management. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that shareholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include a staggered board of directors and the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preference shares, which may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.

As an early stage company without significant investments in security protection, we may not be sufficiently protected against such occurrences.

To qualify as a Reorganization, the Business Combination must satisfy certain requirements, some of which are based on factual determinations, and actions or events after the Business Combination could adversely affect such qualification. For example, under the continuity of business enterprise requirement under U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d), the acquiring corporation must either directly or indirectly through certain controlled corporations, either continue a significant line of the acquired corporation\u2019s historic business or use a significant portion of the acquired corporation\u2019s historic business assets in a business. However, there is an absence of guidance bearing directly on how these rules would apply in the case of an acquisition of a corporation with only investment-type assets, such as the company, or how redemptions by the company, including prior to the date of signing the Business Combination Agreement, would impact this analysis. Moreover, for the Business Combination to qualify as a Reorganization, it is necessary that a substantial part of the value of the proprietary interests in the company be preserved in the Business Combination. If a significant number of our shareholders decide to redeem their public shares, this requirement may not be satisfied, in which case the Business Combination will not qualify as a Reorganization. Because the qualification of the Business Combination as a Reorganization is based on certain facts that will not be known until or following the closing of the Business Combination and the legal uncertainties described above, the qualification of the Business Combination as a Reorganization is subject to significant uncertainty, and is therefore not capable of being the subject of a representation regarding its tax treatment. In addition, neither us nor Webull intends to request a ruling from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Business Combination. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the Business Combination will qualify as a Reorganization, that the IRS will not challenge the Business Combination\u2019s qualification as a Reorganization or that a court will not sustain such a challenge by the IRS. Even if the Business Combination does not qualify as a Reorganization, the parties intend to take the position that the Business Combination, together with the Conversion, qualify as an exchange described in Section 351(a) of the Code (an \u201cExchange\u201d). However, there is a lack of authority supporting the treatment of the Business Combination, together with the Conversion, as an Exchange, and accordingly there is significant uncertainty that the Business Combination would so qualify. Neither us nor Webull intends to request a ruling from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Business Combination as an Exchange, and no assurance can be given that Business Combination will qualify as an Exchange, that the IRS will not challenge this position or that a court will not sustain such a challenge by the IRS. If the Business Combination does not qualify as a Reorganization or an Exchange, then a U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value (as of the closing date of the Business Combination) of Webull Class A Ordinary Shares, Webull Warrants and/or Incentive Warrants received in the Business Combination, over such holder\u2019s aggregate adjusted tax basis in the corresponding company\u2019s public shares and company public warrants surrendered by such holder in the Business Combination. Even if the Business Combination otherwise qualifies as a Reorganization or an Exchange, U.S. Holders may be required to recognize gain (but not loss) in the Business Combination under the PFIC rules, See \u201cWe may be a passive foreign investment company, or \u201cPFIC,\u201d which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. investors.\u201d The tax consequences of the Business Combination are complex and will depend on each U.S. Holder\u2019s particular circumstances. U.S. Holders exchanging their company public shares and/or company public warrants in the Business Combination should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax consequences thereof. In connection with the Business Combination with Webull and during the interim period, we are prohibited from entering into certain transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us or its shareholders. Until the earlier of consummation of the Business Combination or termination of the Business Combination Agreement, we are subject to certain limitations on the operations of its business, including restrictions on its ability to merge, consolidate or amalgamate with or into, or acquire (by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner ) any entity other than Webull.

Holders of record of our ordinary shares wishing to exercise dissenters\u2019 rights and make a demand for payment of the fair market value for his, her or its ordinary shares must give written objection to the First Merger to us prior to the shareholder vote at the extraordinary general meeting to approve the First Merger and follow the procedures set out in Section 238 of the Cayman Companies Act. However, the Business Combination Agreement provides that, if any of our shareholder exercises dissenters\u2019 rights, we shall, in accordance with Section 238 of the Cayman Companies Act, promptly give written notice of the authorization of the First Merger (the \u201cAuthorization Notice\u201d) to each such shareholder who has made a written objection, and unless Webull and us elect by agreement in writing to waive this provision in the Business Combination Agreement, no party shall be obligated to consummate the Business Combination, and the Plan of First Merger shall not be filed with the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands, until at least twenty days shall have elapsed since the date on which the Authorization Notice is given (being the period allowed for written notice of an election to dissent under Section 238 of the Cayman Companies Act, as referred to in Section 239 of the Cayman Companies Act). Section 239 of the Cayman Companies Act states that no such dissenter rights shall be available in respect of shares of any class for which an open market exists on a recognized stock exchange or recognized interdealer quotation system at the expiry date of the period allowed for written notice of an election to dissent provided that the merger consideration constitutes inter alia shares of any company which at the effective date of the merger are listed on a national securities exchange. In circumstances where completion of the First Merger shall be delayed and the limitation under Section 239 of the Cayman Companies Act is invoked, no dissenters\u2019 rights would be available to our shareholders, including those shareholders who previously delivered a written objection to the First Merger prior to the extraordinary general meeting and followed the procedures set out in Section 238 of the Cayman Companies Act in full up to such date, and such holder\u2019s former ordinary shares will thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the First Merger Effective Time, the right to receive one newly issued Webull Class A Ordinary Share for each ordinary share, without interest thereon.

Our efforts to comply with new and changing laws and regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from seeking a business combination target to compliance activities. Moreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. If we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes, we may be subject to penalty and our business may be harmed. There may be tax consequences to our business combinations that may adversely affect us. While we expect to undertake any business combination so as to minimize taxes both to the acquired business and/or asset and us, such business combination might not meet the statutory requirements of a tax-free reorganization, or the parties might not obtain the intended tax-free treatment upon a transfer of shares or assets. A non-qualifying reorganization could result in the imposition of substantial taxes. 65",

            "context": "Shareholder litigation could prevent or delay the closing of the initial business combination or otherwise negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition. We may incur additional costs in connection with the defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation in connection with the proposed initial business combination. Litigation may adversely affect our ability to complete the proposed initial business combination. We could incur significant costs in connection with any such litigation lawsuits, including costs associated with the indemnification of obligations to our directors. Consequently, if a plaintiff were to secure injunctive or other relief prohibiting, delaying or otherwise adversely affecting our ability to complete the proposed initial business combination, then such injunctive or other relief may prevent the proposed initial business combination from becoming effective within the expected timeframe or at all. Risks Associated with Acquiring and Operating a Business in Foreign Countries Because we are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, you may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through the U.S. Federal courts may be limited. We are an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon our directors or officers, or enforce judgments obtained in the United States courts against our directors or officers. Our corporate affairs are governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, the Companies Act and the common law of the Cayman Islands. We are also subject to the federal securities laws of the United States. The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority, but are not binding on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are different from what they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws as compared to the United States, and certain states, such as Delaware, may have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholders derivative action in a Federal court of the United States. We have been advised by Maples and Calder (Cayman) LLP, our Cayman Islands legal counsel, that the courts of the Cayman Islands are unlikely (1) to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state; and (2) in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, to impose liabilities against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state, so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions are penal in nature. In those circumstances, although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated sum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the same matter, impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, or be of a kind the enforcement of which is, contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to public policy). A Cayman Islands Court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. As a result of all of the above, public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by management, members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a United States company. 66",

Holders of units may elect to continue to hold units or separate their units into the component securities. Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we consummated the private placement (the \u201cPrivate Placement\u201d) of 6,600,000 private placement warrants, at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrant in a private placement to our sponsor, generating proceeds of $6.6 million.

In addition, upon the consummation of the initial public offering on June 28, 2022, our sponsor provided us with the first overfunding loan in the amount of $5.0 million to deposit in the trust account at no interest.

The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in its discretion.

Going Concern Consideration As of December 31, 2023, the company had $163,718 in cash and working capital deficit of approximately $6.6 million. Our liquidity needs prior to the consummation of the initial public offering were satisfied through the payment of $25,000 from our sponsor to purchase founder shares, and loan proceeds from our sponsor of $300,000 under a promissory note, dated December 9, 2021 that was later amended on May 5, 2022 (the \u201cNote\u201d). We repaid the Note in full upon closing of the initial public offering. Subsequent to the consummation of the initial public offering, our liquidity has been satisfied through the net proceeds from the consummation of the initial public offering, the overfunding loans and the private placement held outside of the trust account. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, our sponsor, members of our founding team or any of their affiliates may provide us with working capital loans as may be required (of which up to $1.5 million may be converted at the lender\u2019s option into warrants). We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of our acquisition plans. In connection with our assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 205-40, \u201cPresentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern,\u201d we have until September 30, 2024 (or March 31, 2025 as may be approved as described in this Report) to consummate a business combination. It is uncertain that we will be able to consummate a business combination by this time, and if a business combination is not consummated by this date, then there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of our company. Our management has determined that the liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation, should a business combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Our management plans to address this uncertainty through the initial business combination as discussed above. There is no assurance that our plans to consummate the initial business combination will be successful or successful by September 30, 2024 (or March 31, 2025 as may be approved as described in this Report). The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Risks and Uncertainties United States and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the geopolitical instability resulting from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the recent escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict. In response to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (\u201cNATO\u201d) deployed additional military forces to eastern Europe, and the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and other countries have announced various sanctions and restrictive actions against Russia, Belarus and related individuals and entities, including the removal of certain financial institutions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) payment system. Certain countries, including the United States, have also provided and may continue to provide military aid or other assistance to Ukraine and to Israel, increasing geopolitical tensions among a number of nations.

Although the length and impact of the ongoing conflicts are highly unpredictable, they could lead to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain interruptions and increased cyber-attacks against U.S. companies. Additionally, any resulting sanctions could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets and lead to instability and lack of liquidity in capital markets. Any of the above mentioned factors, or any other negative impact on the global economy, capital markets or other geopolitical conditions resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict and subsequent sanctions or related actions, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s search for an initial business combination and any target business with which the Company may ultimately consummate an initial business combination. Results of Operations Our entire activity since inception up to December 31, 2023, related to our formation, the preparation for the initial public offering, and since the closing of the initial public offering, the search for a prospective initial business combination. We will not be generating any operating revenues until the closing and completion of our initial business combination. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we had a net income of approximately $8.1 million, which consisted of approximately $10.6 million in income from investments held in the trust account, offset by approximately $2.2 million in general and administrative expenses (of which $120,000 was for administrative expenses for related party) and approximately $0.3 million in fair value of shares pursuant to non-redemption agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had a net income of approximately $2.1 million, which consisted of approximately $2.8 million in income from investments held in the trust account and change in fair value of derivative liability for the over-allotment option of approximately $21,000, offset by approximately $717,000 in general and administrative expenses (of which $60,000 was for administrative expenses for related party). Contractual Obligations Shareholder and Registration Rights Pursuant to a registration and shareholder rights agreement entered into on June 23, 2022, the holders of founder shares, private placement warrants, Class A ordinary shares underlying the private placement warrants and any warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans and extension loans (and any Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the private placement warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans and extension loans), have registration rights to require us to register a sale of any of the securities held by them. These holders are entitled to certain demand and \u201cpiggy-back\u201d registration rights. However, the registration rights agreement provides that we will not be required to effect or permit any registration or cause any registration statement to become effective until termination of the applicable lock-up period. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Underwriting and Advisory Agreement The underwriter was entitled to an underwriting discount of $0.20 per unit, or $4.0 million in the aggregate, paid upon the closing of the initial public offering. An additional fee of $0.35 per unit, or approximately $7.0 million in the aggregate will be payable to the underwriter for deferred underwriting commissions. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the trust account solely in the event that we complete a business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. We also engaged Cohen & Company Capital Markets (\u201cCCM\u201d) to provide consulting and advisory services to us in connection with the initial public offering, for which it would receive: (i) an advisory fee of $400,000, paid upon the closing of the initial public offering, and (ii) a deferred advisory fee of $700,000 (payable solely in the event that we complete the initial business combination.

Administrative Services Agreement On June 23, 2022, we entered into an agreement with an affiliate of our sponsor, pursuant to which we agreed to pay such affiliate a total of $10,000 per month for secretarial and administrative support services provided to us through the earlier of consummation of the initial business combination and our liquidation. We incurred $120,000 in such fees included as general and administrative expenses on the accompanying statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, we fully paid for such services. We incurred $60,000 in such fees included as general and administrative expenses on the accompanying statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we fully paid for such services. In addition, our sponsor, officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. The audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates and will determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following as critical accounting estimates. Derivative Financial Instruments We evaluate our financial instruments, including equity-linked financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815, \u201cDerivatives and Hedging\u201d (\u201cASC 815\u201d). For freestanding derivative financial instruments that are classified as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recognized at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in the statements of operations each reporting period. The classification of freestanding derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be classified as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. We evaluate embedded conversion features within convertible debt instruments to determine whether the embedded conversion and other features should be bifurcated from the debt host instrument and accounted for as a derivative in accordance with ASC 815. We accounted for public warrants and the private placement warrants in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815. Application of such guidance provides that the warrants are not precluded from equity classification. The warrants were initially measured at fair value. Subsequent changes in fair value are not recognized as long as the contracts continue to be classified in equity. The Over-Allotment Option was recognized as a derivative liability in accordance with ASC 815. Accordingly, we recognized the instrument as a liability at fair value and adjusted the instrument to fair value at each reporting period. On August 9, 2022, following the expiration of the remaining Over-Allotment Option, the sponsor forfeited 510,000 founder shares and the derivative liability was extinguished. 77",

            "context": "Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption We account for our Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC 480. Class A ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Class A ordinary shares (including Class A ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Class A ordinary shares are classified as shareholders\u2019 equity. Our Class A ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, 10,056,597 and 20,960,000 Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption, respectively, are presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders\u2019 deficit section of our balance sheets. We recognize changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying value of the Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. This method would view the end of the reporting period as if it were also the redemption date for the security. Effective with the closing of the initial public offering, we recognized the accretion from initial book value to redemption amount, which resulted in charges against additional paid-in capital (to the extent available) and accumulated deficit. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Our management do not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards updates, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2023, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K and did not have any commitments or contractual obligations. JOBS Act On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act and are allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We elected to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. As an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, we are not required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor\u2019s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO\u2019s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our initial public offering or until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d whichever is earlier. 78",

No compensation of any kind, including finder\u2019s and consulting fees, will be paid to our initial shareholders, officers and directors, or their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection with the completion of an initial business combination. However, these individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made by us to our initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates and determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf. Prior to the consummation of our initial public offering, our sponsor agreed to loan us up to $300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of our initial public offering. These loans were non-interest bearing, unsecured and were due at the earlier of January 1, 2023 and the closing of our initial public offering. The loan was repaid upon the closing of our initial public offering out of the offering proceeds not held in the trust account. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete an initial business combination, we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. On October 30, 2023, our sponsor extended a working capital loan of $380,000 in the form of promissory note, which does not bear interest on the unpaid principal balance and matures upon closing of the company\u2019s initial business combination. Up to $1,500,000 of such working capital loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. The terms of such working capital loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such working capital loans.

However, if we cannot consummate the initial business combination by September 1, 2024 and it is reasonably determined by us and Webull that we may not be able to consummate the initial business combination by September 30, 2024, we will (a) use our reasonable best efforts to cause the our board of directors to approve such amendment to our memorandum and articles of association, as amended, to provide that the date by which we must consummate a business combination in accordance with our memorandum and articles of association, as amended, is extended from September 30, 2024 to March 31, 2025 (such period by which we must consummate a business combination, as amended, and as may be extended in accordance with the provisions of the Business Combination Agreement, the \u201cCombination Period\u201d and such proposal, the \u201cExtension Proposal\u201d) and resolve to recommend that the our shareholders approve such Extension Proposal by special resolution, which is a resolution passed by a majority of at least two-thirds of such members of the company as, being entitled to do so, vote in person or by proxy at a general meeting, and includes a unanimous written resolution (the \u201cExtension Recommendation\u201d), and not change or modify or propose to change or modify the Extension Recommendation, and (b) prepare and file with the SEC proxy statement (such proxy statement, together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the \u201cExtension Proxy Statement\u201d) for the purpose of soliciting proxies from our shareholders for the Extension Proposal, which shall include, among other things, (x) a description and introduction of Webull, and (y) a statement that the Business Combination Agreement and any other transaction documents have been entered into.

            "context": "SK GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2023 Note 1\u2014 Description of Organization, Business Operations, Liquidity and Basis of Presentation SK Growth Opportunities Corporation (the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a blank check company incorporated in Cayman Islands on December 8, 2021 . The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the \u201cBusiness Combination\u201d). The Company is an emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with emerging growth companies. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from December 8, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2023, relates to the Company\u2019s formation and the initial public offering (the \u201cInitial Public Offering\u201d) described below, and since the Initial Public Offering, its search for a Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company generates non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds held in the Trust Account (as defined below). The Company\u2019s sponsor is Auxo Capital Managers LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the \u201cSponsor\u201d). The registration statement for the Company\u2019s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on June 23, 2022. On June 28, 2022, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering of 20,000,000 units (the \u201cUnits\u201d and, with respect to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units, the \u201cPublic Shares\u201d), at $ 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $ 200.0 million, and incurring offering costs of approximately $ 12.0 million, of which $ 7.0 million was for deferred underwriting commissions (see Note 5). The underwriter was granted a 45 -day option from the date of the final prospectus relating to the Initial Public Offering to purchase up to 3,000,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at $ 10.00 per Unit (the \u201cOver-Allotment Option\u201d). On July 20, 2022, pursuant to the underwriter\u2019s notice of the partial exercise of the Over-Allotment Option, the Company sold an additional 960,000 Units, at $ 10.00 per Unit, generating aggregate additional gross proceeds of $ 9.6 million to the Company (the \u201cPartial Over-Allotment Exercise\u201d). On August 9, 2022, following the expiration of the remaining Over-Allotment Option, the Sponsor forfeited 510,000 Founder Shares (as defined in Note 4). Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private placement (\u201cPrivate Placement\u201d) of 6,600,000 warrants of the Company (each, a \u201cPrivate Placement Warrant\u201d and collectively, the \u201cPrivate Placement Warrants\u201d), at a price of $ 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to the Sponsor, generating proceeds of $ 6.6 million (see Note 4). Substantially concurrently with the closing of the Partial Over-Allotment Exercise, the Company completed the sale of 192,000 additional Private Placement Warrants to the Sponsor (the \u201cAdditional Private Placement\u201d) at a purchase price of $ 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $ 192,000 . In addition, upon the consummation of the Initial Public Offering on June 28, 2022, the Sponsor provided the Company with the First Overfunding Loan (as defined in Note 4) in the amount of $ 5.0 million to deposit in the Trust Account at no interest. In connection with the Partial Over-Allotment Exercise on July 20, 2022, the Sponsor provided the Company with the Second Overfunding Loan (as defined in Note 4) in the amount of $ 240,000 to deposit in the Trust Account. Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Partial Over-Allotment Exercise, approximately $ 214.8 million ($ 10.25 per Unit) of net proceeds, including the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, the Partial Over-Allotment Exercise the proceeds of the Overfunding Loans and certain of the proceeds of the Private Placement and the Additional Private Placement, was placed in a trust account (the \u201cTrust Account\u201d) located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and invested only in United States \u201cgovernment securities\u201d within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d) having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below. The Company\u2019s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, the sale of Private Placement Warrants and the proceeds from the Overfunding Loan, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. The Company must complete one or more initial Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at F-7 least 80 % of the net assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting discounts held in Trust and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination. However, the Company only intends to complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50 % or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. The Company will provide the holders of the Company\u2019s Public Shares (the \u201cPublic Shareholders\u201d) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholders meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then held in the Trust Account (initially at $ 10.25 per Public Share). The per-share amount to be distributed to Public Shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriter (as discussed in Note 5). The Public Shares are recognized at redemption value and classified as temporary equity, in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 480, \u201cDistinguishing Liabilities from Equity\u201d (\u201cASC 480\u201d). The Company will proceed with a Business Combination if a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a shareholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (the \u201cArticles of Association\u201d), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem the Public Shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the initial shareholders (as defined below) agreed to vote their Founder Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination. In addition, the initial shareholders agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and Public Shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination. The Articles of Association provides that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15 % of the Public Shares included in the Units issued in the Company\u2019s Initial Public Offering, without the prior consent of the Company. The holders of the Founder Shares (the \u201cinitial shareholders\u201d) agreed not to propose an amendment to the Articles of Association (A) to modify the substance or timing of the Company\u2019s obligation to allow redemption in connection with a Business Combination or to redeem 100 % of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below) or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders\u2019 rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity, unless the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. On December 27, 2023, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the \u201cExtension Meeting\u201d), to (i) amend the Company\u2019s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (the \u201cMemorandum and Articles of Association\u201d) to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from December 28, 2023 to September 30, 2024, or such earlier date as the Company\u2019s board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) may approve in accordance with the Memorandum and Articles of Association (such amendment, the \u201cArticles Amendment\u201d and such proposal, the \u201cExtension Amendment Proposal\u201d), (ii) amend the Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated June 23, 2022, by and between the Company and Continental, to extend the date on which Continental must liquidate the Trust Account if the Company has not completed its initial business combination, from December 28, 2023 to September 30, 2024, or such earlier date as the Board may approve (the \u201cTrust Amendment Proposal\u201d). The Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Amendment Proposal were approved. F-8",

            "context": "In connection with the vote to approve the Articles Amendment, the holders of 10,903,403 Class A Ordinary Shares of the Company properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately $ 10.88 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $ 118,642,864 . If the Company cannot consummate the initial business combination by September 1, 2024 and it is reasonably determined by the Company and Webull (as defined below) that it may not be able to consummate the initial Business Combination by September 30, 2024, the Company shall (a) use its reasonable best efforts to cause the board of directors to approve such amendment to the memorandum and articles of association, as amended, to provide that the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination in accordance with the memorandum and articles of association, as amended, is extended from September 30, 2024 to March 31, 2025 (such period by which the Company must consummate a business combination, as amended, and as may be extended in accordance with the provisions of the Business Combination Agreement, the \u201cCombination Period\u201d and such proposal, the \u201cExtension Proposal\u201d) and resolve to recommend that the shareholders approve such Extension Proposal by special resolution, which is a resolution passed by a majority of at least two-thirds of such members of the company as, being entitled to do so, vote in person or by proxy at a general meeting, and includes a unanimous written resolution (the \u201cExtension Recommendation\u201d), and not change or modify or propose to change or modify the Extension Recommendation, and (b) prepare and file with the SEC proxy statement (such proxy statement, together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the \u201cExtension Proxy Statement\u201d) for the purpose of soliciting proxies from the shareholders for the Extension Proposal, which shall include, among other things, (x) a description and introduction of Webull, and (y) a statement that the Business Combination Agreement and any other transaction documents have been entered into. The Company shall discuss in good faith with Webull and agree upon the terms of the Extension Proposal, including the proposed amendments to the memorandum and articles of association and additional economic incentives, if any, to be offered to the shareholders in connection with their approval of the Extension Proposal. If the Company is unable to consummate an initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at aper-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less taxes payable and up to $ 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders\u2019 rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to the Company\u2019s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. The initial shareholders agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the initial shareholders acquire Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriter agreed to waive its rights to the deferred underwriting commission (see Note 5) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within in the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be only $ 10.25 . In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party (except for the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement (a \u201cTarget\u201d), reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) $ 10.25 per Public Share or (ii) the lesser amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or Target that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account nor will it apply to any claims under the Company\u2019s indemnity of the underwriter of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. F-9 On August 10, 2022, the Company announced that, effective August 15, 2022, the Company\u2019s Class A ordinary shares and warrants comprising each issued and outstanding Unit will commence trading separately under the ticker symbols \u201cSKGR\u201d and \u201cSKGW,\u201d respectively. Holders of Units may elect to continue to hold Units or separate their Units into the component securities. Going Concern Consideration As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $ 163,718 in cash and working capital deficit of approximately $ 6.6 million. The Company\u2019s liquidity needs prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering were satisfied through the payment of $ 25,000 from the Sponsor to purchase Founder Shares, and loan proceeds from the Sponsor of $ 300,000 under the Note (as defined in Note 4). The Company repaid the Note in full upon closing of the Initial Public Offering. Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company\u2019s liquidity has been satisfied through the net proceeds from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement held outside of the Trust Account. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor, members of the Company\u2019s founding team or any of their affiliates may provide the Company with Working Capital Loans (as defined in Note 4) as may be required (of which up to $ 1.5 million may be converted at the lender\u2019s option into warrants). On October 30, 2023, the Sponsor loaned the Company $ 380,000 and the Company issued an unsecured promissory note in the total principal amount of up to $ 380,000 to the Sponsor. On March 1, 2024, the Company issued an unsecured convertible promissory note in the total principal amount of up to nine hundred thousand dollars ($ 900,000 ) (the \u201cSponsor Note\u201d) to Sponsor. The Sponsor Note does not bear interest on the unpaid principal balance and matures upon closing of the Company\u2019s initial business combination. In the event that the Company does not consummate an initial business combination, the Sponsor Note will be repaid solely to the extent that the Company has funds available to it, if any, outside of its trust account established in connection with its initial public offering of its securities. The proceeds of the Sponsor Note will be used to fund ongoing operating expenses of the Company. The total principal amount of the Sponsor Note may be converted, in whole or in part, at the option of the Sponsor, (i) into warrants of the Company at a price of $ 1.00 per warrant, with each warrant exercisable for one Class A ordinary share, par value $ 0.0001 per share, of the Company (\u201cClass A Ordinary Share\u201d), or (ii) into Class A Ordinary Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the amount of accrued and outstanding of the Promissory Note, by (ii) $ 10.00 . The warrants will be identical to the private placement warrants issued to the Sponsor at the time of the initial public offering of the Company. In connection with the Company\u2019s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 205-40, \u201cPresentation of Financial Statements\u2014Going Concern,\u201d the Company has until September 30, 2024 (or such earlier date as the board of directors may approve in accordance with the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association), to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time, and if a Business Combination is not consummated by this date, then there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. Management has determined that the liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Management plans to address this uncertainty through the initial Business Combination as discussed above. There is no assurance that the Company\u2019s plans to consummate the initial Business Combination will be successful or successful within the Combination Period. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Risks and Uncertainties United States and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the geopolitical instability resulting from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the recent escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict. In response to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (\u201cNATO\u201d) deployed additional military forces to eastern Europe, and the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and other countries have announced various sanctions and restrictive actions against Russia, Belarus and related individuals and entities, including the removal of certain financial institutions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) payment system. Certain countries, including the United States, have also provided and may continue to provide military aid or other assistance to Ukraine and to Israel, increasing geopolitical tensions among a number of nations. The Russia-Ukraine conflict and the escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict and the resulting measures that have been taken, and could be taken in the future, by NATO, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Israel and its neighboring states and other countries have created global security concerns that could have a lasting impact on regional and global economies. Although the length and impact of the ongoing conflicts are highly unpredictable, they could lead to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain interruptions and increased cyberattacks against U.S. companies. Additionally, any resulting sanctions could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets and lead to instability and lack of liquidity in capital markets.

            "context": "Note 4\u2014Related Party Transactions Founder Shares On December 9, 2021, the sponsor purchased 8,625,000 Class B ordinary shares, par value $ 0.0001 (the \u201cFounder Shares\u201d), to cover certain expenses on the Company\u2019s behalf for an aggregate purchase price of $ 25,000 . On February 24, 2022, 1,437,500 Class B ordinary shares were surrendered and thereupon cancelled by the Company. On May 5, 2022, 1,437,500 Class B ordinary shares were surrendered and thereupon cancelled by the Company resulting in a decrease in the total number of Class B ordinary shares outstanding to 5,750,000 shares. The Sponsor agreed to forfeit up to an aggregate of 750,000 Founder Shares to the extent that the option to purchase additional Units is not exercised in full by the underwriter or is reduced, so that the Founder Shares would represent 20 % of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding shares upon the Initial Public Offering. On July 20, 2022, the Company sold an additional 960,000 Units in the Partial Over-Allotment Exercise pursuant to the underwriter\u2019s notice of the partial exercise of the Over-Allotment Option. On August 9, 2022, following the expiration of the remaining Over-Allotment Option, the Sponsor forfeited 510,000 Founder Shares. The initial shareholders, and the executive officers and directors of the Company, agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of (i) one year after the completion of the initial Business Combination; and (ii) subsequent to the initial Business Combination (x) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the shareholders having the right to exchange their Class A ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property or (y) if the closing price of Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $ 12.00 per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30 -trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the initial Business Combination. Any permitted transferees will be subject to the same restrictions and other agreements of the initial shareholders with respect to any Founder Shares. In February and March 2022, the Sponsor transferred an aggregate of 90,000 Class B ordinary shares to the Company\u2019s independent director nominees. The sale of the Founder Shares is in the scope of ASC 718. The Founders Shares were granted subject to a performance condition (i.e., the occurrence of a Business Combination). Compensation expense related to the Founders Shares is recognized only when the performance condition is probable of occurrence under the applicable accounting literature in this circumstance. As of December 31, 2023, the Company determined that a Business Combination is not considered probable, and, therefore, no stock-based compensation expense has been recognized. Stock-based compensation will be recognized at the date a Business Combination is considered probable (i.e., upon consummation of a Business Combination) in an amount equal to the number of Founders Shares that ultimately vest multiplied times the grant date fair value per share (unless subsequently modified) less the amount initially received for the purchase of the Founders Shares. Private Placement Warrants Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the Private Placement of 6,600,000 Private Placement Warrants, at a price of $ 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, in a private placement to the Sponsor, generating proceeds of $ 6.6 million. Substantially concurrently with the closing of the Partial Over-Allotment Exercise, the Company completed the Additional Private Placement of 192,000 additional Private Placement Warrants to the Sponsor at a purchase price of $ 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $ 192,000 . A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was added to the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless. The purchasers of the Private Placement Warrants agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of their Private Placement Warrants (except to permitted transferees) until 30 days after the completion of the initial Business Combination. Related Party Loans Promissory Note to Sponsor The Sponsor agreed to loan the Company up to $ 300,000 to be used for the payment of costs related to the Initial Public Offering pursuant to a promissory note, dated on December 9, 2021 and was later amended on May 5, 2022 (the \u201cNote\u201d). The Note was non-interest bearing, unsecured and due upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering. The Company borrowed $ 300,000 under the Note and repaid the Note in full upon closing of the Initial Public Offering. The Note was no longer available to draw on after the consummation of the Initial Public Offering. F-15 Overfunding Loans On June 28, 2022, in connection with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor loaned the Company $ 5.0 million under a non-interest bearing loan agreement (the \u201cFirst Overfunding Loan\u201d) to deposit in the Trust Account. On July 20, 2022, in connection with the Partial Over-Allotment Exercise, the Sponsor provided the Company with the second Overfunding Loan in the amount of $ 240,000 to deposit in the Trust Account under the same terms (the \u201cSecond Overfunding Loan\u201d, together, the \u201cOverfunding Loans\u201d). The Overfunding Loans will be repaid upon the closing of an initial Business Combination or converted into Class A ordinary shares at a conversion price of $ 10.00 per Class A ordinary share (or a combination of both), at the Sponsor\u2019s discretion, provided that any such conversion may not occur until August 22, 2022. If the Company does not complete an initial Business Combination, it will not repay the Overfunding Loans from amounts held in the Trust Account, and the Trust Account proceeds will be distributed to the Public Shareholders; however, the Company may repay the Overfunding Loans if there are funds available outside the Trust Account to do so. Working Capital Loans In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company\u2019s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (\u201cWorking Capital Loans\u201d). If the Company completes a Business Combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination or, at the lender\u2019s discretion, up to $ 1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into warrants of the post Business Combination entity at a price of $ 1.00 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no borrowings under the Working Capital Loans. Promissory Note On October 30, 2023, the Sponsor loaned the Company $ 380,000 and the Company issued an unsecured promissory note in the total principal amount of up to $ 380,000 to the Sponsor. The Promissory Note does not bear interest on the unpaid principal balance and matures upon closing of the Company\u2019s initial business combination. In the event that the Company does not consummate an initial business combination, the promissory note will be repaid solely to the extent that the Company has funds available to it, if any, outside of its trust account established in connection with its initial public offering of its securities. The proceeds of the promissory note will be used to fund ongoing operating expenses of the Company. The total principal amount of the promissory note may be converted, in whole or in part, at the option of the Sponsor into warrants of the post-business combination company at a price of $ 1.00 per warrant, with each warrant exercisable for one Class A ordinary share, par value $ 0.0001 per share, of the post-business combination company. The warrants will be identical to the private placement warrants issued to the Sponsor at the time of the initial public offering of the Company. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $ 380,000 and $ 0 , respectively, in borrowings under the Promissory Note. Extension Loans In order to extend the time available for the Company to consummate its initial Business Combination by an additional three months each time , the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees may provide an Extension Loan to the Company to provide funds to deposit into the Trust Account an additional amount of $ 0.10 per share each time. The Extension Loan will be provided under the form of a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note. Such Extension Loans may be converted into warrants upon the consummation of the initial business combination, at a price of $ 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. If the Company completes the initial Business Combination, and the lender decides not to convert the Extension Loans into warrants, the Company would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the F-16",

In addition, on the terms and subject to the conditions of the Sponsor Support Agreement, Webull agreed to indemnify Sponsor and each other SPAC Insider for any U.S. federal (and applicable U.S. state and U.S. local) income taxes, together with any interests and penalties (the \u201cIndemnifiable Amounts\u201d) payable by Sponsor or the SPAC Insiders, as applicable, solely arising from or attributable to the failure of the Mergers to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) or as an exchange described in Section 351 of the Code, provided, however, that the Company shall not have any liability in respect of any Indemnifiable Amounts to the extent that the aggregate amount of such Indemnifiable Amounts exceeds $ 5,000,000 . On February 27, 2024, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., agreed to waive its entitlement to the payment of any underwriting discount due to it pursuant to the Underwiring Agreement in connection with the Company\u2019s potential business combination with Webull. On March 1, 2024, the Company issued an unsecured convertible promissory note in the total principal amount of up to nine hundred thousand dollars ($ 900,000 ) (the \u201cSponsor Note\u201d) to Sponsor. The Sponsor Note does not bear interest on the unpaid principal balance and matures upon closing of the Company\u2019s initial business combination. In the event that the Company does not consummate an initial business combination, the Sponsor Note will be repaid solely to the extent that the Company has funds available to it, if any, outside of its trust account established in connection with its initial public offering of its securities. The proceeds of the Sponsor Note will be used to fund ongoing operating expenses of the Company. The total principal amount of the Sponsor Note may be converted, in whole or in part, at the option of the Sponsor, (i) into warrants of the Company at a price of $ 1.00 per warrant, with each warrant exercisable for one Class A ordinary share, par value $ 0.0001 per share, of the Company (\u201cClass A Ordinary Share\u201d), or (ii) into Class A Ordinary Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the amount of accrued and outstanding of the Promissory Note, by (ii) $ 10.00 . The warrants will be identical to the private placement warrants issued to the Sponsor at the time of the initial public offering of the Company. F-21",
