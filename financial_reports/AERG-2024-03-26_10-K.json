Continuous wave laser systems are typically used to heat a target and, during continuous illumination, this heat transfer leads to melting or charring of the material. Using continuous wave output powers that now exceed 100 kilowatts (1kW = 1000 watts), it can take anywhere from seconds to minutes to impact a target. By contrast, Applied Energetics has delivered USP lasers to national security users that exceed five terawatts (1 TW = 1 trillion watts) in peak power, with the difference being that this peak power from a USP laser is delivered in a pulse that is less than a trillionth of a second. During this short pulse duration, and having such a high peak intensity, near-instantaneous ablation of the surface of the threat takes place.

Over the past several years, a relatively small number of major defense contractors have received significant funding for directed energy systems development, manufacturing and integration, using continuous wave, high energy laser and microwave technologies. These contractors specialize in different directed energy system platforms to respond to a variety of threats. Applied Energetics believes that its pulsed laser systems can be a part of a layered defense solution alongside these other technologies. Although AE competes against other directed energy systems for funding, the uniqueness of our technologies should continue to support their development into weapon platform programs. AE believes that there is renewed U.S. Government interest in directed energy applications and believes that continued development of its USP capabilities and growing interest from all branches of the U.S. armed forces and other government agencies will lead to increases in government spending on directed energy in the coming years. Likewise, there are multiple new threats that must be addressed with unique and emerging technologies, and AE is working diligently to rapidly advance development, demonstration, testing and engineering of the Advanced Ultrashort Pulse lasers throughout the spectrum from the ultraviolet to the far infrared.

On September 30, 2023, President Biden signed a Continuing Resolution (CR), HR 5860, which extended the government operations through November 17, 2023, and he then signed three further CRs, including HR 6363 on November 11, 2023 extending through January 19, 2024, HR 2872 extending through March 1, 2024, and HR 7463, extending through March 8, 2024, as to four of the 12 annual budget bills, and through March 22, 2024 for the remaining eight. On March 23, 2024, the Defense Appropriations Bill was passed and signed by President Biden which will ensure the US government is funded through September 30, 2024 and that new government contracts can be funded during the 2024 fiscal year.

According to the US Department of Defense fiscal budgets from 2017 through 2023, its directed energy spending grew from approximately $500 million in 2017 to over $1.695 billion in 2023, an increase of nearly 240%. Market analysis and projections have estimated that this directed energy sector is anticipated to reach $17.8 billion globally by 2028. We continue to be optimistic about our future and the growing opportunities in directed energy applications, especially since this growth to nearly $1.7 B annually is being accomplished without a recognized Program of Record (POR) for directed energy platforms. We believe that once these technologies are funded in production for a POR, these DOD budgets for directed energy will grow exponentially larger to support the technology insertion. The Applied Energetics team anticipates a continuation of strong funding for the directed energy community.

We estimate forfeitures when recognizing compensation expense and adjust this estimate over the requisite service period should actual forfeitures differ from such estimates.

Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

This assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of those controls. This assessment also took into consideration a material weakness cited by our auditors. In particular, our auditors noted lack of segregation of duties and written policies and procedures with the accounting functions and evidence of control review in that we have not designed such policies and procedures at a sufficient level to support the operating effectiveness of controls to prevent and detect potential error. To mitigate this weakness, our auditors suggested that the company continue to maintain sufficient accounting personnel to ensure segregation of duties and accurate accounting records, noting that we use an outside consultant to perform day-to-day review function and that we create, document and maintain policies and procedures. Our management intends to take this guidance into consideration as we work to resolve this weakness. Based on our assessment under the criteria described above, the CFO has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2023.",

Management bases its assumptions on historical experiences and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In addition, management considers the basis and methodology used in developing and selecting these estimates, the trends in and amounts of these estimates, specific matters affecting the amount of and changes in these estimates, and any other matters related to these estimates, including significant issues concerning accounting principles and financial statement presentation. Such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein. Significant estimates include revenue recognition, carrying amounts of long-lived assets, valuation assumptions for share-based payments, evaluation of debt modification accounting, effective borrowing rate determinations, analysis of fair value transferred upon debt extinguishment, valuation and calculation of measurements of income tax assets and liabilities.",

We make the following assumptions relative to this model: (i) the annual dividend yield is zero as we do not pay dividends on common stock, (ii) the weighted-average expected life is based on a midpoint scenario, where the expected life is determined to be half of the time from grant to expiration, regardless of vesting, (iii) the risk free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury security rate for the expected life, and (iv) the volatility is based on the level of fluctuations in our historical share price for a period equal to the weighted-average expected life. We estimate forfeitures when recognizing compensation expense and adjust this estimate over the requisite service period should actual forfeitures differ from such estimates.
