We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a \u201cshell company\u201d as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.",

Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share.

However, prior to the 24-month anniversary of the consummation of our Public Offering, we instructed Continental to liquidate the U.S. government treasury obligations or money market funds held in the Trust Account and have maintained the funds in the Trust Account in cash in an interest-bearing demand deposit account at a bank until the earlier of the consummation of our initial business combination or our liquidation. Interest on the deposit account is currently 3.5-4.0% per annum, but such deposit account carries a variable rate and we cannot assure you that such rate will not decrease or increase significantly. On March 17, 2023, we announced that we entered into a non-binding letter of intent (\u201cLOI\u201d) for a potential business combination with a private company in the urban mobility sector. No assurances can be made that we will be successful in completing the business combination. On March 24, 2023, we held a special meeting of stockholders (the \u201cFirst Extension Meeting\u201d) to, in part, amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend the date by which we have to consummate a business combination from March 28, 2023 (the \u201cOriginal Termination Date\u201d) to June 28, 2023 (the \u201cPrevious Charter Extension Date\u201d) and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date to consummate a Business Combination on a monthly basis up to nine times by an additional one month each time after the Previous Charter Extension Date, by resolution of our board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d), if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days\u2019 advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until March 28, 2024 or a total of up to twelve months after the Original Termination Date, unless the closing of a business combination shall have occurred prior thereto. For each monthly extension of the Previous Charter Extension Date we deposited $160,000 into the Trust Account. In connection with that vote, the holders of 17,404,506 Class A common stock of the Company properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for an aggregate price of approximately $10.48 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $182,460,110. After the satisfaction of such redemptions, the balance in our trust account was approximately $58,660,352 (including interest not previously released to the Company but net of expected franchise and income taxes payable). On March 28, 2024, we held a stockholder meeting (the \u201cSecond Extension Meeting\u201d) to amend the Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the \u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d) to (i) extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from March 28, 2024 (the \u201cTermination Date\u201d) to April 28, 2024 (the \u201cCharter Extension Date\u201d) and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date to consummate a business combination on a monthly basis up to eleven times by an additional one month each time after the Charter Extension Date, by resolution of the Board if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days\u2019 advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until March 28, 2025 (each, an \u201cAdditional Charter Extension Date\u201d) or a total of up to twelve months after the Termination Date, unless the closing of a business combination shall have occurred prior thereto (the \u201cExtension Amendment Proposal\u201d); (ii) eliminate from the Certificate of Incorporation the limitation that the Company may not redeem Class A Common Stock (as defined herein) to the extent that such redemption would result in the Company having net tangible assets of less than $5,000,0001 in order to allow the Company to redeem Class A Common Stock irrespective of whether such redemption would exceed the Redemption Limitation (the \u201cRedemption Limitation Amendment Proposal\u201d); and (iii) provide for the right of a holder of the Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 (\u201cClass B Common Stock) to convert such Class B Common Stock into the Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis prior to the closing of a business combination at the election of the holder (the \u201cFounder Share Amendment Proposal\u201d).

            "context": "Effecting Our Initial Business Combination General We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time following the Public Offering. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Public Offering and the private placement of the Private Placement Warrants, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination, shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. Business Strategy We intend to identify and effect a business combination with a company, or companies, within the direct selling industry that we believe can benefit from the vast experience and expertise of our management team, as well as the access to capital markets our vehicle can provide. We are positioning ourselves as a powerful partner to industry companies, ownership groups and management teams based on our ability to provide growth capital and liquidity in an environment where it can otherwise prove challenging. Our Access to Industry Companies is Unique and Differentiating Our target evaluation and selection process will rely on the incomparable network and relationships of our management, board of directors and sponsor teams. Through their various business endeavors and extended service to the direct selling industry, we believe our team is the most connected group in the direct selling industry worldwide. Due to the nature and extent of these relationships, our team is already intimately familiar with the business, financials and prospects of many companies within our target universe. This allows us to quickly engage with potential targets and we expect the evaluation process to move quickly in each case The Direct Selling Industry is Traditionally Underserved by Capital Markets The direct selling industry has been traditionally underserved by the capital markets for a variety of reasons. Most direct selling companies are self-funded by their founders, or by a close network of industry investors. The nature of the business allows these companies to grow profitably and scale out of cash flow. This ability diminishes the need for these companies to develop relationships with the financial community through much of their early existence. Consequently, there exists an information gap and a lack of understanding between many industry companies and the various financial constituencies. As a result, liquidity and growth capital opportunities are not as readily available to many direct selling companies as they would be to similarly-situated companies in other industries. We believe that our expertise, reputation, and relationships will ideally position us to bridge this gap. Our Team will be the Industry\u2019s Preferred Partner The members of our management team, board of directors and extended sponsor team are well-known and highly-respected across the direct selling industry. Industry ownership groups and C-suite executives know us, our reputations and abilities and know that we understand their businesses and customers. As a result, we believe that we will be seen as the preferred sponsorship group by industry companies as compared to competing groups. We Believe We Will Experience Little Competition for Target Companies We believe that our relationships within, and knowledge of, the direct selling industry will provide us access to proprietary and first-look deal flow not available to other potential acquirors and/or special purpose acquisition companies. As previously mentioned, we believe that a disconnect exists between direct selling companies and the capital markets. The majority of direct selling companies are family-owned, or closely held, entities that may not typically consider the public markets without the guidance of a team such as ours. Market Inefficiencies Exist Between Private and Public Direct Selling Company Valuations Due to the disconnect and lack of understanding between the capital markets and the direct selling industry, there is a lack of a consistent, competitive bid for many private industry participants. Private equity firms are hesitant to take minority positions in companies they do not fully understand, and, likewise, industry participants are hesitant to sell a control stake in their business to firms that do not understand how to operate them. Conversely, the publicly traded comparable companies within the industry have performed exceptionally well over the years. We believe that the lack of a competitive bid and/or similarly beneficial alternatives will allow us to effect our business combination at a desirable valuation. 11",

A properly executed international expansion program can be capital-intensive, but also provides a relatively quick return on investment. |\n| \u2022 | Technology Utilization: Technology, and in particular mobile technology, continues to shift the way we work, shop, communicate and play on a daily basis. The playing field is ever-evolving and shifting providing all businesses and industries the opportunity to either grow or be left behind. Within the direct selling industry, as with many others, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adaption to, and implementation of, a wide variety of technologies. As a historically face-to-face business, many direct selling companies have otherwise been slow to adapt to some of the new technologies; however, the transition has proved to be remarkably effective. We believe the direct selling industry is evolving from a \u201cwork from home\u201d model to a \u201cwork from phone\u201d model, allowing industry sales forces to work and run their businesses from anywhere, anytime. As such, we believe that seamless mobile applications and features such as mobile sampling platforms are critical to the future success of industry participants. Our team has extensive experience in these areas and the ability to assist and guide target companies in each of the relevant aspects, including branding, social marketing and selling, as well as mobile applications that provide a seamless distributor and customer experience. |\n| \u2022 | Product Line Expansion: The independent sales forces and customer bases of direct selling companies represent a captive, engaged audience numbering, in the case of the majority of our target universe, in the hundreds of thousands, if not millions. These companies serve as a compelling platform for the introduction of new products and new product categories to that captive audience. We believe a significant opportunity exists to introduce new products to the existing channel through the acquisition of existing direct to consumer (\u201cDTC\u201d) brands and/or proprietary intellectual property. Our team also possesses the expertise, know-how and relationships to expand a target\u2019s current offerings through the development of additional products and/or product categories to supplement the target\u2019s current offerings. |\n| \u2022 | Data: Our team possesses knowledge, expertise and experience in certain forms of data analysis utilizing data points and indicators that are specific to the direct selling industry and that we believe to be unique. These methods of analysis will be utilized in our target evaluation process and will assist in the identification of both positive and negative trends within a target company\u2019s business. Additionally, we believe that these methods of analysis will be highly beneficial post-business combination in identifying opportunities to accelerate growth. |\n| 1.) | Minimum five-year operating history: We seek target companies that have established themselves as long-term growth companies.

Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Delaware law. We expect that if an opportunity is presented to one of our officers or directors in his or her capacity as an officer or director of one of those other entities, such opportunity would be presented to such other entity and not to us. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. We may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our initial business combination. We intend to effect a business combination with a company with an enterprise value significantly above the net proceeds of the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants. Depending on the size of the transaction or the number of public shares we become obligated to redeem, we may potentially utilize several additional financing sources, including but not limited to the issuance of additional securities to the sellers of a target business, debt issued by banks or other lenders or the owners of the target, a private placement to raise additional funds, or a combination of the foregoing. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. In addition, following our initial business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient to meet our obligations or our working capital needs, we may need to obtain additional financing. Initial Business Combination Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting commissions held in trust) at the time of signing the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses or we are considering an initial business combination with an affiliated entity, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent valuation or accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity securities of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to 14",

If less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% of net assets test described above. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we will be subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination. Redemption Rights for Holders of Public Shares Upon Consummation of Our Initial Business Combination We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and less up to $100,000 to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Our initial stockholders, sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and any public shares that they hold in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our Charter: (a) conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E under the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and (b) file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. Resources and Competition Our Charter provides that we will have only until the Termination Date to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by the Termination Date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and less up to $100,000 to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders\u2019 rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in each case, to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other special purpose acquisition companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Additionally, the number of special purpose acquisition companies looking for business combination targets has increased compared to recent years and many of these special purpose acquisition companies are sponsored by entities or persons that have significant experience with completing business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 15",

On March 24, 2023, we held the First Extension Meeting to, in part, amend our charter to extend our Termination Date from the Original Termination Date to the Previous Charter Extension Date and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date to consummate a Business Combination on a monthly basis up to nine times by an additional one month each time after the Previous Charter Extension Date, by resolution of our Board, if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days\u2019 advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until March 28, 2024 or a total of up to twelve months after the Original Termination Date, unless the closing of a business combination shall have occurred prior thereto. For each monthly extension of the Charter Extension Date deposited $160,000 into the Trust Account. In connection with that vote, the holders of 17,404,506 Class A common stock of the Company properly exercised their right to redeem their shares. Our initial stockholders and management team also may from time to time purchase shares of Class A common stock prior to our initial business combination. Our Charter provides that, if we seek stockholder approval of an initial business combination, such initial business combination will be approved if we receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares voted at such meeting, including the Founder Shares. As a result, in addition to our initial stockholders\u2019 Founder Shares, we could need none (assuming only the minimum number shares of Common Stock representing a quorum are voted) of our currently outstanding public shares sold in the Public Offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved. Accordingly, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, the agreement by our initial stockholders and management team to vote in favor of our initial business combination will increase the likelihood that we will receive the requisite stockholder approval for such initial business combination. 19",

            "context": "The ability of our public stockholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into a business combination with a target. We may seek to enter into a business combination transaction agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights, we would not be able to meet such closing condition and, as a result, would not be able to proceed with the business combination. Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests make us unable to satisfy a minimum cash condition as described above, we would not proceed with such redemption and the related business combination and may instead search for an alternate business combination. Prospective targets will be aware of these risks and, thus, may be reluctant to enter into a business combination transaction with us. The ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure. At the time we enter into an agreement for our initial business combination, we will not know how many stockholders may exercise their redemption rights, and therefore will need to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption. If our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the Trust Account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the Trust Account to meet such requirements, or arrange for third party financing. In addition, if a larger number of shares are submitted for redemption than we initially expected, we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the Trust Account or arrange for third party financing. Raising additional third-party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. Furthermore, this dilution would increase to the extent that the anti-dilution provision of the Class B common stock results in the issuance of shares of Class A common stock on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the shares of Class B common stock at the time of our initial business combination. In addition, the amount of the deferred underwriting commissions payable to the underwriters will not be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed in connection with an initial business combination. The per share amount we will distribute to stockholders who properly exercise their redemption rights will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions and after such redemptions, the amount held in trust will continue to reflect our obligation to pay the entire deferred underwriting commissions. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete the most desirable business combination available to us or optimize our capital structure. The ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares could increase the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful and that you would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem your shares. If our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the Trust Account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful is increased. If our initial business combination is unsuccessful, you would not receive your pro rata portion of the Trust Account until we liquidate the Trust Account. If you are in need of immediate liquidity, you could attempt to sell your shares in the open market; however, at such time our shares may trade at a discount to the pro rata amount per share in the Trust Account. In either situation, you may suffer a material loss on your investment or lose the benefit of funds expected in connection with your exercise of redemption rights until we liquidate or you are able to sell your shares in the open market. 20",

            "context": "The requirement that we complete our initial business combination by the Termination Date may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination and may limit the time we have in which to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets, in particular as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our initial business combination on terms that would produce value for our stockholders. Any potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning a business combination will be aware that we must complete our initial business combination by the Termination Date. Consequently, such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating a business combination, knowing that if we do not complete our initial business combination with that particular target business, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination with any target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the timeframe described above. In addition, we may have limited time to conduct due diligence and may enter into our initial business combination on terms that we would have rejected upon a more comprehensive investigation. Our search for a business combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected by epidemics, pandemics, disease outbreaks or quarantines, including the resurgence of new variants of COVID-19 on our ability to consummate an initial business combination and the status of debt and equity markets. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in, and another infectious disease outbreak, epidemic or pandemic could result in, a widespread health crisis that adversely affects the economies and financial markets worldwide, and the business of any potential target business with which we consummate a business combination could be materially and adversely affected. If the disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or other matters of global concern continue for an extensive period of time, our ability to consummate a business combination, or the operations of a target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be adversely affected in a material way In addition, our ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on our ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by an epidemic, pandemic, disease outbreak or quarantine, including a resurgence of new variants of COVID-19 and other events, including increased market volatility or decreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all. Finally, a sustained or prolonged COVID-19 resurgence or other epidemic, pandemic or disease outbreak may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, such as those related to the market for our securities. We may not be able to complete our initial business combination by the Termination Date, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate. We may not be able to find a suitable target business and complete our initial business combination by the Termination Date. Our ability to complete our initial business combination may be negatively impacted by general market conditions, volatility in the capital and debt markets and the other risks described herein. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic and rising interest rates could limit our ability to complete our initial business combination, including as a result of increased market volatility, decreased market liquidity and third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all. Additionally, the outbreak of COVID-19 and rising interest rates may negatively impact businesses we may seek to acquire. If we have not completed our initial business combination within such time period or during any extended period of time that we may have to consummate an initial business combination as a result of an amendment to our Charter (an \u201cExtension Period\u201d), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and less up to $100,000 to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders\u2019 rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case, to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 21",

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination, although they are under no obligation to do so. There is no limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and NYSE rules. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material non-public information), our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination or not redeem their public shares. However, other than as expressly stated herein, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the Trust Account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. Such purchases may include a contractual acknowledgment that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that our sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination, (ii) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met or (iii) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. We expect any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public \u201cfloat\u201d of our Class A common stock or public warrants and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, possibly making it difficult to obtain or maintain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. If a stockholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with our initial business combination, or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed. We will comply with the proxy rules or tender offer rules, as applicable, when conducting redemptions in connection with our initial business combination. Despite our compliance with these rules, if a stockholder fails to receive our proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, such stockholder may not become aware of the opportunity to redeem its shares. In addition, proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will describe the various procedures that must be complied with in order to validly tender or submit public shares for redemption.

In addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a stockholder vote, we intend to require a public stockholder seeking redemption of its public shares to also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent two business days prior to the vote in which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included. In the event that a stockholder fails to comply with these or any other procedures disclosed in the proxy or tender offer materials, as applicable, its shares may not be redeemed. You will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies. Since the net proceeds of the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants are intended to be used to complete an initial business combination with a target business that has not been selected, we may be deemed to be a \u201cblank check\u201d company under the United States securities laws. However, because we had net tangible assets in excess of $5,000,000 upon the completion of the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants and filed a Current Report on Form 8-K, including an audited balance sheet demonstrating this fact, we are exempt from rules promulgated by the SEC to protect investors in blank check companies, such as Rule 419. Accordingly, investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules. Among other things, this means our units were immediately tradable and we have a longer period of time to complete our initial business combination than do companies subject to Rule 419. Moreover, if the IPO were subject to Rule 419, the rule would prohibit the release of any interest earned on funds held in the trust account to us unless and until the funds in the trust account were released to us in connection with out completion of an initial business combination. If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, and if you or a \u201cgroup\u201d of stockholders are deemed to hold in excess of 15% of our Class A common stock, you will lose the ability to redeem all such shares in excess of 15% of our Class A common stock. If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Charter provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined in Section 13 of the Exchange Act ), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Public Offering without our prior consent, which we refer to as the \u201cExcess Shares.\u201d However, we would not be restricting our stockholders\u2019 ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. Our stockholders\u2019 inability to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce our stockholders influence over our ability to complete our initial business combination and stockholders could suffer a material loss on your investment in us if you sell Excess Shares in open-market transactions. Additionally, you will not receive redemption distributions with respect to the Excess Shares if we complete our initial business combination. And as a result, our stockholders will continue to hold that number of shares exceeding 15% and, in order to dispose of such shares, would be required to sell their shares in open-market transactions, potentially at a loss. Because of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by the Termination Date, our public stockholders may receive only their pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account that are available for distribution to public stockholders, and our warrants will expire worthless. We expect to encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess similar or greater technical, human and other resources to ours or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors.

            "context": "combination targets has increased compared to recent years and many of these special purposes acquisition companies are sponsored by entities or persons that have significant experience with completing business combinations. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, we are obligated to offer holders of our public shares the right to redeem their shares for cash at the time of our initial business combination in conjunction with a stockholder vote or via a tender offer. Target companies will be aware that this may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by the Termination Date, our public stockholders may receive only their pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account that are available for distribution to public stockholders, and our warrants will expire worthless. If the net proceeds of the Public Offering not being held in the Trust Account are insufficient to allow us to operate until the Termination Date, it could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and complete our initial business combination, and we will depend on loans from our sponsor or management team to fund our search and to complete our initial business combination. Of the net proceeds of the Public Offering, only $1,900,000 was initially available to us outside of the Trust Account to fund our working capital requirements. We believe that funds available to us outside of the Trust Account will be sufficient to allow us to operate until the Termination Date; however, we cannot assure you that our estimate is accurate. Of the funds available to us, we could use a portion of the funds available to us to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business. We could also use a portion of the funds as a down payment or to fund a \u201cno-shop\u201d provision (a provision in letters of intent or merger agreements designed to keep target businesses from \u201cshopping\u201d around for transactions with other companies or investors on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into a letter of intent or merger agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business and were subsequently required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise), we might not have sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conduct due diligence with respect to, a target business. If we are required to seek additional capital, we would need to borrow funds from our sponsor, management team or other third parties to operate or may be forced to liquidate. Neither our sponsor, members of our management team nor any of their affiliates is under any obligation to advance funds to us in such circumstances. Any such advances would be repaid only from funds held outside the Trust Account or from funds released to us upon completion of our initial business combination. Our sponsor has loaned us $3,615,718.75 as of December 31, 2023 through our issuance of a promissory note (the \u201cOriginal Note\u201d) to the sponsor in the principal amount of $2,300,000 on December 28, 2022 and our issuance of a promissory note (the \u201cSecond Note\u201d) to the sponsor in the principal amount of $480,000 on March 27, 2023. The Original Note was issued in connection with extending our Termination Date from December 28, 2022 to March 28, 2023 and the Second Note was issued in connection with extending our Termination Date from March 28, 2023 to June 28, 2023. On May 5, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note (the \u201cThird Note\u201d) in the principal amount of $835,718.75 to the Sponsor. The Third Note does not bear interest and matures upon closing of the Company\u2019s initial business combination. In the event that the Company does not complete an initial business combination, the Third Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account, or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. The Third Note is subject to customary events of default, the occurrence of which automatically trigger the unpaid principal balance of the Note and all other sums payable with regard to the Third Note becoming immediately due and payable. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into Private Placement Warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. Such warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our Trust Account. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. Consequently, our public stockholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account that are available for distribution to public stockholders, and our warrants will expire worthless. 24",

The funds in the Trust Account may not protect those funds from third party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public stockholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if they execute such agreements they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our management will consider whether competitive alternatives are reasonably available to us and will only enter into an agreement with such third party if management believes that such third party\u2019s engagement would be in the best interests of the company under the circumstances. The underwriters of the Public Offering as well as our independent registered public accounting firm will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by public stockholders could be less than the $10.20 per public share initially held in the Trust Account, due to claims of such creditors. Pursuant to the letter agreement the form of which is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement relating to the Public Offering, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.20 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.20 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor did it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor\u2019s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the Trust Account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.20 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. Our directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the Trust Account available for distribution to our public stockholders. 25",

While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment and subject to their fiduciary duties may choose not to do so in any particular instance.

Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations.

            "context": "On January 24, 2024, the SEC issued final rules (the \u201c2024 SPAC Rules\u201d), effective no sooner than 125 days following the publication of the 2024 SPAC Rules in the Federal Register, that formally adopted some of the SEC\u2019s proposed rules for SPACs that were released on March 30, 2022. The 2024 SPAC Rules, among other items, impose additional disclosure requirements in initial public offerings by SPACs and business combination transactions involving SPACs and private operating companies; amend the financial statement requirements applicable to business combination transactions involving such companies; update and expand guidance regarding the general use of projections in SEC filings, including requiring disclosure of all material bases of the projections and all material assumptions underlying the projections; increase the potential liability of certain participants in proposed business combination transactions; and could impact the extent to which SPACs could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act. In the event that the Business Combination has not been consummated by the time the 2024 SPAC Rules become effective, such rules may materially adversely affect our business, including our ability to complete, and the costs associated with, the Business Combination, and results of operations. If we are deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we would be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities would be severely restricted. As a result, in such circumstances, unless we are able to modify our activities so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we may abandon our efforts to complete the Business Combination and instead liquidate the Company. As described further above, the 2024 SPAC Rules relate, among other matters, to the circumstances in which SPACs such as the Company could potentially be subject to the Investment Company Act and the regulations thereunder. The 2024 SPAC Rules would provide a safe harbor for such companies from the definition of \u201cinvestment company\u201d under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act, provided that a SPAC satisfies certain criteria, including a limited time period to announce and complete a de-SPAC transaction. Specifically, to comply with the safe harbor, the 2024 SPAC Rules would require a company to file a report on Form 8-K announcing that it has entered into an agreement with a target company for a business combination no later than 18 months after the effective date of its registration statement for its initial public offering (the \u201cIPO Registration Statement\u201d). The Company would then be required to complete its initial business combination no later than the 24-month anniversary of the closing of the Public Offering. If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, our activities would be severely restricted. For example, we may face restrictions on the nature of our investments and restrictions on the issuance of securities. In addition, we would be subject to burdensome compliance requirements. We do not believe that our principal activities will subject us to regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. However, if we are deemed to be an investment company and subject to compliance with and regulation under the Investment Company Act, we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and expenses for which we have not allotted funds. As a result, unless we are able to modify our activities so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we may abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead liquidate the Company. Were we to liquidate, our warrants would expire worthless, and our securityholders would lose the investment opportunity associated with an investment in the combined company, including any potential price appreciation of our securities. To mitigate the risk that we might be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we have liquidated the investments held in the Trust Account and instead the funds are held in the Trust Account in cash items until the earlier of the consummation of our initial business combination or our liquidation. Following the liquidation of investments in the Trust Account, we have received minimal interest on the funds held in the Trust Account, which has reduced the dollar amount our Public Stockholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company. Initially, the funds in the Trust Account had, since our initial public offering, been held only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. government treasury obligations and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. However, to mitigate the risk of us being deemed to be an unregistered investment company (including under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act) and thus subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, we liquidated the U.S. government treasury obligations or money market funds held in the Trust Account and instructed Continental, the trustee with respect to the Trust Account, to 27",

            "context": "maintain the funds in the Trust Account in cash in an interest-bearing demand deposit account at a bank until the earlier of the consummation of our initial business combination or the liquidation of the Company. Interest on such deposit account is currently approximately 3.5-4.0% per annum, but such deposit account carries a variable rate and the Company cannot assure you that such rate will not decrease or increase significantly. Following such liquidation, we have received minimal interest on the funds held in the Trust Account. However, interest previously earned on the funds held in the Trust Account still may be released to us to pay our taxes, if any. As a result, the decision to hold all funds in the Trust Account in cash items has reduced the dollar amount our Public Stockholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company. In the adopting release for the 2024 SPAC Rules, the SEC provided guidance that a SPAC\u2019s potential status as an \u201cinvestment company\u201d depends on a variety of factors, such as a SPAC\u2019s duration, asset composition, business purpose and activities and \u201cis a question of facts and circumstances\u201d requiring individualized analysis. If we were deemed to be subject to compliance with and regulation under the Investment Company Act, we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and expenses for which we have not allotted funds. Unless we are able to modify our activities so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we would either register as an investment company or wind down and abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead to liquidate the Company. Our stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination by the Termination Date may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If a corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder\u2019s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. However, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the Termination Date in the event we do not complete our initial business combination and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with the foregoing procedures. Because we will not comply with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the 10 years following our dissolution. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations are limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. If our plan of distribution complies with Section 281(b) of the DGCL, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder\u2019s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would likely be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend beyond the third anniversary of such date. Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination by the Termination Date is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. 28",

In accordance with NYSE\u2019s corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual meeting until no later than one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on the NYSE. Under Section 211(b) of the DGCL, we are, however required to hold an annual meeting of stockholders for the purposes of electing directors in accordance with our bylaws unless such election is made by written consent in lieu of such a meeting. We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, and thus we may not be in compliance with Section 211(b) of the DGCL, which requires an annual meeting. Therefore, if our stockholders want us to hold an annual meeting prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, they may attempt to force us to hold one by submitting an application to the Delaware Court of Chancery in accordance with Section 211(c) of the DGCL. Although we have identified general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses, we may enter into our initial business combination with a target that does not meet such criteria and guidelines, and as a result, the target business with which we enter into our initial business combination may not have attributes entirely consistent with our general criteria and guidelines. Although we have identified general criteria and guidelines for evaluating prospective target businesses, it is possible that a target business with which we enter into our initial business combination will not have all of these positive attributes. If we complete our initial business combination with a target that does not meet some or all of these guidelines, such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a business that does meet all of our general criteria and guidelines. In addition, if we announce a prospective business combination with a target that does not meet our general criteria and guidelines, a greater number of stockholders may exercise their redemption rights, which may make it difficult for us to meet any closing condition with a target business that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. In addition, if stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, it may be more difficult for us to attain stockholder approval of our initial business combination if the target business does not meet our general criteria and guidelines. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account that are available for distribution to public stockholders, and our warrants will expire worthless. 29",

            "context": "We may attempt to complete our initial business combination with a private company about which little information is available, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all. In pursuing our business combination strategy, we may seek to effectuate our initial business combination with a privately held company. Very little public information generally exists about private companies, and we could be required to make our decision on whether to pursue a potential initial business combination on the basis of limited information, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all. We may seek business combination opportunities with a high degree of complexity that require significant operational improvements, which could delay or prevent us from achieving our desired results. We may seek business combination opportunities with large, highly complex companies that we believe would benefit from operational improvements. While we intend to implement such improvements, to the extent that our efforts are delayed or we are unable to achieve the desired improvements, the business combination may not be as successful as we anticipate. To the extent we complete our initial business combination with a large complex business or entity with a complex operating structure, we may also be affected by numerous risks inherent in the operations of the business with which we combine, which could delay or prevent us from implementing our strategy. Although our management team will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business and its operations, we may not be able to properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors until we complete our business combination. If we are not able to achieve our desired operational improvements, or the improvements take longer to implement than anticipated, we may not achieve the gains that we anticipate. Furthermore, some of these risks and complexities may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks and complexities will adversely impact a target business. Such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a smaller, less complex organization. We do not have a specified maximum redemption threshold. The absence of such a redemption threshold may make it possible for us to complete our initial business combination with which a substantial majority of our stockholders or warrant holders do not agree. Our Charter does not provide a specified maximum redemption threshold. In addition, our proposed initial business combination may impose a minimum cash requirement for (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions. As a result, we may be able to complete our initial business combination even though a substantial majority of our public stockholders do not agree with the transaction and have redeemed their shares or, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, have entered into privately negotiated agreements to sell their shares to our sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of our Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares in connection with such initial business combination, all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination. In order to effectuate an initial business combination, special purpose acquisition companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and other governing instruments, including their warrant agreements. We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our Charter or governing instruments in a manner that will make it easier for us to complete our initial business combination that our stockholders may not support. 33",

            "context": "In order to effectuate a business combination, special purpose acquisition companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and governing instruments, including their warrant agreements. For example, special purpose acquisition companies have amended the definition of business combination, increased redemption thresholds and extended the time to consummate an initial business combination and, with respect to their warrants, amended their warrant agreements to require the warrants to be exchanged for cash and/or other securities. Amending our Charter requires the approval of holders of 65% of our common stock, and amending our warrant agreement requires a vote of holders of at least 50% of the public warrants and, solely with respect to any amendment to the terms of the Private Placement Warrants or any provision of the warrant agreement with respect to the Private Placement Warrants, 50% of the number of the then outstanding Private Placement Warrants. In addition, our Charter requires us to provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash if we propose an amendment to our Charter to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete an initial business combination by the Termination Date or with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders\u2019 rights or pre-initial business combination activity. To the extent any of such amendments would be deemed to fundamentally change the nature of the securities offered through the registration statement relating to the Public Offering, we would register, or seek an exemption from registration for, the affected securities. We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our Charter or governing instruments or extend the time to consummate an initial business combination in order to effectuate our initial business combination. The provisions of our Charter that relate to our pre-business combination activity (and corresponding provisions of the agreement governing the release of funds from our Trust Account) may be amended with the approval of holders of 65% of our common stock, which is a lower amendment threshold than that of some other special purpose acquisition companies. It may be easier for us, therefore, to amend our Charter to facilitate the completion of an initial business combination that some of our stockholders may not support. Our Charter provides that any of its provisions related to pre-business combination activity (including the requirement to deposit proceeds of the Public Offering and the private placement of warrants into the Trust Account and not release such amounts except in specified circumstances, and to provide redemption rights to public stockholders) may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock entitled to vote thereon, and corresponding provisions of the trust agreement governing the release of funds from our Trust Account may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock entitled to vote thereon. In all other instances, our Charter may be amended by holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock entitled to vote thereon, subject to applicable provisions of the DGCL or applicable stock exchange rules. Our initial stockholders, who collectively beneficially own approximately 67.9% of our common stock, may participate in any vote to amend our Charter and/or trust agreement and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. As a result, we may be able to amend the provisions of our Charter which govern our pre-business combination behavior more easily than some other special purpose acquisition companies, and this may increase our ability to complete a business combination with which you do not agree. Our stockholders may pursue remedies against us for any breach of our Charter. Our sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed, pursuant to written agreements with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our Charter to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by the Termination Date or with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders\u2019 rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and less up to $100,000 to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. Our stockholders are not parties to, or third-party beneficiaries of, these agreements and, as a result, will not have the ability to pursue remedies against our sponsor, executive officers, directors or director nominees for any breach of these agreements. As a result, in the event of a breach, our stockholders would need to pursue a stockholder derivative action, subject to applicable law. Certain agreements related to the Public Offering may be amended without stockholder approval. Each of the agreements related to the Public Offering to which we are a party, other than the warrant agreement and the investment management trust agreement, may be amended without stockholder approval. Such agreements are: the underwriting agreement; the letter agreement among us and our initial stockholders, sponsor, officers and directors; the registration rights agreement among us and our initial stockholders; the Private Placement Warrants purchase agreement between us and our sponsor; and the administrative services agreement among us, our 34",

For example, our letter agreement and the underwriting agreement contain certain lock-up provisions with respect to the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and other securities held by our initial stockholders, sponsor, officers and directors. Amendments to such agreements would require the consent of the applicable parties thereto and would need to be approved by our board of directors, which may do so for a variety of reasons, including to facilitate our initial business combination. While we do not expect our board of directors to approve any amendment to any of these agreements prior to our initial business combination, it may be possible that our board of directors, in exercising its business judgment and subject to its fiduciary duties, chooses to approve one or more amendments to any such agreement. Any amendment entered into in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination will be disclosed in our proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, related to such initial business combination, and any other material amendment to any of our material agreements will be disclosed in a filing with the SEC. Any such amendments would not require approval from our stockholders, may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible, and may have an adverse effect on the value of an investment in our securities. For example, amendments to the lock-up provision discussed above may result in our initial stockholders selling their securities earlier than they would otherwise be permitted, which may have an adverse effect on the price of our securities. We may be unable to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination or to fund the operations and growth of a target business, which could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular business combination. We are targeting businesses with enterprise values that are greater than we could acquire with the net proceeds of the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants. As a result, if the cash portion of the purchase price exceeds the amount available from the Trust Account, net of amounts needed to satisfy any redemption by public stockholders, we may be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial business combination. We cannot assure you that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to complete our initial business combination, we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. Further, we may be required to obtain additional financing in connection with the closing of our initial business combination for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, or to fund the purchase of other companies. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account that are available for distribution to public stockholders, and our warrants will expire worthless. In addition, even if we do not need additional financing to complete our initial business combination, we may require such financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. None of our officers, directors or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial business combination. Our initial stockholders and Antara control a substantial interest in us and thus may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support. As of the date of this Annual Report, our initial stockholders and Antara owned 6,705,100 shares of common stock, which represented approximately 79.1% of our outstanding common stock. On March 28, 2024, we held the Second Extension Meeting to, in part, amend our charter to extend our Termination Date to the Charter Extension Date and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date to consummate a Business Combination on a monthly basis up to eleven times by an additional one month each time after the Charter Extension Date, by resolution of the Board if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days\u2019 advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until March 28, 2025 (each, an \u201cAdditional Charter Extension Date\u201d) or a total of up to twelve months after the Termination Date, unless the closing of a business combination shall have occurred prior thereto. For each such monthly extension, the Sponsor (or one or more of its affiliates or permitted designees) will deposit $90,000 into the Trust Account.

Therefore, our initial stockholders and Antara may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that our stockholders do not support, including amendments to our Charter. Factors that would be considered in making such additional purchases would include consideration of the current trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, our board of directors, whose members were elected by our sponsor, is and will be divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior to the completion of our initial business combination, in which case all of the current directors will continue in office until at least the completion of the business combination. If there is an annual meeting of stockholders, as a consequence of our \u201cstaggered\u201d board of directors, only a minority of the board of directors will be considered for election and our initial stockholders, because of their ownership position, will have considerable influence regarding the outcome. In addition, prior to the completion of an initial business combination, holders of a majority of our Founder Shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason. Accordingly, our initial stockholders will continue to exert control at least until the completion of our initial business combination. Because we must furnish our stockholders with target business financial statements, we may lose the ability to complete an otherwise advantageous initial business combination with some prospective target businesses. The federal proxy rules require that the proxy statement with respect to the vote on an initial business combination include historical and pro forma financial statement disclosure. We will include the same financial statement disclosure in connection with our tender offer documents, whether or not they are required under the tender offer rules. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d), or international financial reporting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\u201cIFRS\u201d), depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d). These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such financial statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. Compliance obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may make it more difficult for us to effectuate our initial business combination, require substantial financial and management resources, and increase the time and costs of completing an initial business combination. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls for our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Only in the event that we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. Further, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. The fact that we are a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome on us as compared to other public companies because a target business with which we seek to complete our initial business combination may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination. As the number of special purpose acquisition companies evaluating targets increases, attractive targets may become scarcer and there may be more competition for attractive targets. This could increase the cost of our initial business combination and could result in our inability to find a target or to consummate an initial business combination. 36",

A number of potential targets for special purpose acquisition companies have already been acquired, and there are still many special purpose acquisition companies pursuing an initial business combination. As a result, fewer attractive targets may be available to consummate an initial business combination. In addition, because there are more special purpose acquisition companies seeking to enter into an initial business combination with available targets, the competition for targets may increase and, as a result, the terms of business combination transactions with available targets could become less favorable to us. Attractive transactions could also become scarcer for other reasons, such as economic or industry sector downturns, geopolitical tensions, or increases in the cost of additional capital needed to close business combinations or operate targets post-business combination. This could increase the cost of, delay or otherwise complicate or frustrate our ability to find and consummate an initial business combination, and may result in our inability to consummate an initial business combination on terms favorable to us. Our management team and our sponsor may make a profit on any initial business combination, even if any public stockholders who did not redeem their shares would experience a loss on that business combination. As a result, the economic interests of our management team and our sponsor may not fully align with the economic interests of public stockholders. Like most special purpose acquisition companies (\u201cSPACs\u201d), our structure may not fully align the economic interests of our sponsor and those persons, including our officers and directors, who have interests in our sponsor with the economic interests of our public stockholders.

Assuming a trading price of $10.00 per share upon consummation of our initial business combination, the 5,750,000 Founder Shares would have an aggregate implied value of $50,750,000. Even if the trading price of our Class A common stock was as low as $2.04, and the Private Placement Warrants were worthless, the value of the Founder Shares would be equal to the sponsor\u2019s initial investment in us. As a result, so long as we complete an initial business combination, our sponsor is likely to be able to recoup its investment in us and make a substantial profit on that investment, even if our public shares lose significant value. We may reincorporate in another jurisdiction in connection with our initial business combination and such reincorporation may result in taxes imposed on stockholder. We may, in connection with our initial business combination and subject to requisite stockholder approval under the Companies Act, reincorporate in the jurisdiction in which the target company or business is located or in another jurisdiction. The transaction may require a stockholder or warrant holder to recognize taxable income in the jurisdiction in which the stockholder or warrant holder is a tax resident or in which its members are resident if it is a tax transparent entity. We do not intend to make any such cash distributions to stockholder or warrant holders to pay such taxes. Stockholder or warrant holders may be subject to withholding taxes or other taxes with respect to their ownership of us after the reincorporation. We are subject to changing law and regulations regarding regulatory matters, corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of non-compliance. We are subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies, including for example, the SEC, which are charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded, and to new and evolving regulatory measures under applicable law. Our efforts to comply with new and changing laws and regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from seeking a business combination target. Moreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. If we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes, we may be subject to penalty and our business may be harmed. 37",

            "context": "Accordingly, our sponsor and members of our management team who own interests in our sponsor may have incentives to pursue and consummate an initial business combination quickly, with a risky or not well established target business, and/or on transaction terms favorable to the equity holders of the target business, rather than continue to seek a more favorable business combination transaction that could result in an improved outcome for our public stockholders or liquidate and return all of the cash in the trust to the public stockholders. For the foregoing reasons, you should consider our sponsor\u2019s and management team\u2019s financial incentive to complete an initial business combination when evaluating whether to purchase our public shares and/or redeem your public shares prior to or in connection with an initial business combination. Certain of our officers and directors have or will have direct and indirect economic interests in us and/or our sponsor after the consummation of our initial public offering and such interests may potentially conflict with those of our public stockholders as we evaluate and decide whether to recommend a potential business combination to our public stockholders. Certain of our officers and directors may own membership interests in our sponsor and indirect interests in our Class B common stock and private placement warrants which may result in interests that differ from the economic interests of the investors in our initial public offering, which includes making a determination of whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. There may be a potential conflict of interest between our officers and directors that hold membership interests in our sponsor and our public stockholders that may not be resolved in favor of our public stockholders. We may not be able to complete the Business Combination with certain potential target companies if a proposed transaction with the target company may be subject to review or approval by regulatory authorities pursuant to certain U.S. or foreign laws or regulations. Certain acquisitions or business combinations may be subject to review or approval by regulatory authorities pursuant to certain U.S. or foreign laws or regulations. In the event that such regulatory approval or clearance is not obtained, or the review process is extended beyond the period of time that would permit the Business Combination to be consummated with us, we may not be able to consummate the Business Combination with such target. Among other things, the U.S. Federal Communications Act prohibits foreign individuals, governments, and corporations from owning more a specified percentage of the capital stock of a broadcast, common carrier, or aeronautical radio station licensee. In addition, U.S. law currently restricts foreign ownership of U.S. airlines. In the United States, certain mergers that may affect competition may require certain filings and review by the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, and investments or acquisitions that may affect national security are subject to review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (\u201cCFIUS\u201d). CFIUS is an interagency committee authorized to review certain transactions involving foreign investment in U.S. businesses or assets with a nexus to U.S. interstate commerce. Outside the United States, laws or regulations may affect our ability to consummate a business combination with potential target companies incorporated or having business operations in jurisdiction where national security considerations, involvement in regulated industries (including telecommunications), or in businesses relating to a country\u2019s culture or heritage may be implicated. In December 2022, Antara acquired a majority economic, non-voting interest in the Sponsor. Antara was founded by Himanshu Gulati in 2018 and invests across a wide variety of financial instruments, including loans, bonds, convertible bonds, stressed/distressed credit and special situation equity investments. U.S. and foreign regulators generally have the power to deny the ability of the parties to consummate a transaction or to condition approval of a transaction on specified terms and conditions, which may not be acceptable to us or a target. In such event, we may not be able to consummate a transaction with that potential target. As a result of these various restrictions, the pool of potential targets with which we could complete the Business Combination may be limited, and we may be adversely affected in terms of competing with other SPACs that do not have similar ownership issues. Moreover, the process of government review, could be lengthy. Because we have only a limited time to complete the Business Combination, our failure to obtain any required approvals within the requisite time period may hinder our ability to complete the Business Combination.

This will also cause you to lose any potential investment opportunity in a target company and the chance of realizing future gains on your investment through any price appreciation in the combined company. Risks Relating to the Post-Business Combination Company Subsequent to our completion of our initial business combination, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and the price of our securities, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment. Even if we conduct extensive due diligence on a target business with which we combine, we cannot assure you that this diligence will identify all material issues that may be present with a particular target business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining debt financing to partially finance the initial business combination or thereafter. Accordingly, any stockholders or warrant holders who choose to remain stockholders or warrant holders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such stockholders or warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission. Resources could be wasted in researching business combinations that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account that are available for distribution to public stockholders, and our warrants will expire worthless. We anticipate that the investigation of each specific target business and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If we decide not to complete a specific initial business combination, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, if we reach an agreement relating to a specific target business, we may fail to complete our initial business combination for any number of reasons including those beyond our control. Any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account that are available for distribution to public stockholders, and our warrants will expire worthless. Our ability to successfully effect our initial business combination and to be successful thereafter will be dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, some of whom may join us following our initial business combination. The loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. Our ability to successfully effect our initial business combination is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel.

While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after our initial business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a company regulated by the SEC, which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements. Our key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business combination, and a particular business combination may be conditioned on the retention or resignation of such key personnel. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following our initial business combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous. Our key personnel may be able to remain with our company after the completion of our initial business combination only if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for such individuals to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to us after the completion of the business combination. Such negotiations also could make such key personnel\u2019s retention or resignation a condition to any such agreement. The personal and financial interests of such individuals may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, subject to their fiduciary duties under Delaware law. We may have a limited ability to assess the management of a prospective target business and, as a result, may effect our initial business combination with a target business whose management may not have the skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. When evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with a prospective target business, our ability to assess the target business\u2019s management may be limited due to a lack of time, resources or information. Our assessment of the capabilities of the target business\u2019s management, therefore, may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities we suspected. Should the target business\u2019s management not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to manage a public company, the operations and profitability of the post-combination business may be negatively impacted. Accordingly, any stockholders or warrant holders who choose to remain stockholders or warrant holders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such stockholders or warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission. The officers and directors of an acquisition candidate may resign upon completion of our initial business combination. The loss of a business combination target\u2019s key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. The role of an acquisition candidate\u2019s key personnel upon the completion of our initial business combination cannot be ascertained at this time. Although we contemplate that certain members of an acquisition candidate\u2019s management team will remain associated with the acquisition candidate following our initial business combination, it is possible that members of the management of an acquisition candidate will not wish to remain in place. Our management may not be able to maintain control of a target business after our initial business combination. We cannot provide assurance that, upon loss of control of a target business, new management will possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business. We may structure our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for us 40",

Even if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares of Class A common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares of Class A common stock, our stockholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding Class A common stock subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority stockholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company\u2019s shares than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain control of the target business. Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate or challenges by tax authorities could harm our future results. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and may become subject to various non-U.S. jurisdictions as well. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the allocation of our pre-tax earnings and losses among countries with differing statutory tax rates, in certain non-deductible expenses as a result of acquisitions, in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or in federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax laws and accounting principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents. Increases in our effective tax rate would adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we may be subject to income tax audits by various tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The application of tax laws in such jurisdictions may be subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax authorities in these jurisdictions. Although we believe our income tax liabilities are reasonably estimated and accounted for in accordance with applicable laws and principles, an adverse resolution of one or more uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. Our initial business combination and our structure thereafter may not be tax-efficient to our stockholders and warrant holders. As a result of our business combination, our tax obligations may be more complex, burdensome and uncertain. Although we will attempt to structure our initial business combination in a tax-efficient manner, tax structuring considerations are complex, the relevant facts and law are uncertain and may change, and we may prioritize commercial and other considerations over tax considerations. For example, in connection with our initial business combination and subject to any requisite stockholder approval, we may structure our business combination in a manner that requires stockholders and/or warrant holders to recognize gain or income for tax purposes, effect a business combination with a target company in another jurisdiction, or reincorporate in a different jurisdiction (including, but not limited to, the jurisdiction in which the target company or business is located). We do not intend to make any cash distributions to stockholders or warrant holders to pay taxes in connection with our business combination or thereafter. Accordingly, a stockholder or a warrant holder may need to satisfy any liability resulting from our initial business combination with cash from its own funds or by selling all or a portion of the shares received. In addition, stockholders and warrant holders may also be subject to additional income, withholding or other taxes with respect to their ownership of us after our initial business combination. In addition, we may effect a business combination with a target company that has business operations outside of the United States, and possibly, business operations in multiple jurisdictions. If we effect such a business combination, we could be subject to significant income, withholding and other tax obligations in a number of jurisdictions with respect to income, operations and subsidiaries related to those jurisdictions. Due to the complexity of tax obligations and filings in other jurisdictions, we may have a heightened risk related to audits or examinations by U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. taxing authorities. This additional complexity and risk could have an adverse effect on our after-tax profitability and financial condition. 41",

Accordingly, any indemnification provided will be able to be satisfied by us only if (i) we have sufficient funds outside of the Trust Account or (ii) we consummate an initial business combination. Our obligation to indemnify our officers and directors may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our officers or directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against our officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders. Furthermore, a stockholder\u2019s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against our officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions.

Our executive officers and directors will allocate their time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs. This conflict of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our executive officers and directors are not required to, and will not, commit their full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and our search for a business combination and their other businesses. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Each of our executive officers is engaged in several other business endeavors for which he may be entitled to substantial compensation, and our executive officers are not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours per week to our affairs. Our independent directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities.

Until we consummate our initial business combination, we intend to engage in the business of identifying and combining with one or more businesses. A number of our officers and directors presently have, and any of them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to another entity prior to its presentation to us. Our Charter provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation.

However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination because our management team has significant experience in identifying and executing multiple acquisition opportunities simultaneously, and as we believe there are a number of potential opportunities within the industries and geographies of our primary focus. Our executive officers, directors, security holders and their respective affiliates may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests. We have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, executive officers, security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary or financial interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. In fact, we may enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our sponsor, our directors or executive officers, although we do not intend to do so. Nor do we have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. Accordingly, such persons or entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours. The personal and financial interests of our directors and officers may influence their motivation in timely identifying and selecting a target business and completing a business combination. Consequently, our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 discretion in identifying and selecting a suitable target business may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether the terms, conditions and timing of a particular business combination are appropriate and in our stockholders\u2019 best interest. If this were the case, it would be a breach of their fiduciary duties to us as a matter of Delaware law and we or our stockholders might have a claim against such individuals for infringing on our stockholders\u2019 rights. However, we might not ultimately be successful in any claim we may make against them for such reason. We are dependent upon our executive officers and directors and their loss could adversely affect our ability to operate. Our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of individuals and, in particular, our executive officers and directors.

Our directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities. Such entities may compete with us for business combination opportunities. Although we will not be specifically focusing on, or targeting, any transaction with any affiliated entities, we would pursue such a transaction if we determined that such affiliated entity met our criteria for a business combination and such transaction was approved by a majority of our independent and disinterested directors. Despite our agreement to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm regarding the fairness to our company from a financial point of view of a business combination with one or more domestic or international businesses affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers, directors or existing holders, potential conflicts of interest still may exist and, as a result, the terms of the business combination may not be as advantageous to our public stockholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest. 43",

On June 7, 2021, our sponsor paid an aggregate of $25,000 to purchase 5,750,000 Founder Shares, or approximately $0.004 per share. Prior to the initial investment in the company of $25,000 by the sponsor, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible. The purchase price of the Founder Shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash contributed to the company by the number of Founder Shares issued. The number of Founder Shares outstanding was determined based on the expectation that the total size of the Public Offering would be a maximum of 23,000,000 units if the underwriters\u2019 over-allotment option was exercised in full, and therefore that such Founder Shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares after the Public Offering. The Founder Shares will be worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination. In addition, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 11,700,000 Private Placement Warrants, each exercisable for one share of Class A common stock at $11.50 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $11,700,000, or $1.00 per warrant, that will also be worthless if we do not complete our initial business combination.

This risk may become more acute the Termination Date nears.

As a result, certain of those persons may have been, may be or may become involved in proceedings, investigations and litigation relating to the business affairs of the companies with which they were, are or may be in the future be affiliated.

Any such litigation, investigations or other proceedings may divert the attention and resources of the members of both our management team and our board of directors away from identifying and selecting a target business or businesses for our initial business combination and may negatively affect our reputation, which may impede our ability to complete an initial business combination. Risks Relating to our Securities You will not have any rights or interests in funds from the Trust Account, except under certain limited circumstances. Therefore, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss. Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business combination, and then only in connection with those shares of Class A common stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described herein, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our Charter to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by the Termination Date, and (iii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete an initial business combination within the Termination Date, subject to applicable law and as further described herein. In addition, if our plan to redeem our public shares if we are unable to complete an initial business combination by the Termination Date is not completed for any reason, compliance with Delaware law may require that we submit a plan of dissolution to our then-existing stockholders for approval prior to the distribution of the proceeds held in our Trust Account.

The warrant agreement provides that in the following circumstances holders of warrants who seek to exercise their warrants will not be permitted to do for cash and will, instead, be required to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act: (i) if the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act in accordance with the terms of the warrant agreement; (ii) if we have so elected and the shares of Class A common stock is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of \u201ccovered securities\u201d under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act; and (iii) if we have so elected and we call the public warrants for redemption. If you exercise your public warrants on a cashless basis, you would pay the warrant exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the \u201cfair market value\u201d of our shares of Class A common stock (as defined in the next sentence) over the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the fair market value. The \u201cfair market value\u201d is the average reported closing price of the shares of Class A common stock for the ten trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of exercise is received by the warrant agent or on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants, as applicable. As a result, you would receive fewer shares of Class A common stock from such exercise than if you were to exercise such warrants for cash. We have not registered the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws, and such registration may not be in place when an investor desires to exercise warrants, thus precluding such investor from being able to exercise its warrants except on a cashless basis and potentially causing such warrants to expire worthless. We have not registered the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. However, under the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed that, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days, after the closing of our initial business combination, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement covering the registration under the Securities Act of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and thereafter will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the same to become effective within 60 business days following our initial business combination and to maintain a current prospectus relating to the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so if, for example, any facts or events arise which represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement or prospectus related to the Public Offering, the financial statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current or correct or the SEC issues a stop order. If the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act, under the terms of the warrant agreement, holders of warrants who seek to exercise their warrants will not be permitted to do so for cash and, instead, will be required to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption from registration. In no event will warrants be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we are not obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration or qualification is available. 46",

In the event we so elect, we are not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement or register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under applicable state securities laws, and in the event we do not so elect, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under applicable state securities laws to the extent an exemption is not available. Exercising the warrants on a cashless basis could have the effect of reducing the potential \u201cupside\u201d of the holder\u2019s investment in our company because the warrant holder will hold a smaller number of shares of Class A common stock upon a cashless exercise of the warrants they hold than upon a cash exercise. In no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant, or issue securities (other than upon a cashless exercise as described above) or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws. If the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or qualified or exempt from registration or qualification, the holder of such warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of units will have paid the full unit purchase price solely for the shares of Class A common stock included in the units. There may be a circumstance in which an exemption from registration exists for holders of our Private Placement Warrants to exercise their warrants while a corresponding exemption does not exist for holders of the public warrants included as part of units sold in the Public Offering. In such an instance, our sponsor and its permitted transferees (which may include our directors and executive officers) would be able to exercise their warrants and sell the shares of Class A common stock underlying their warrants while holders of our public warrants would not be able to exercise their warrants and sell the underlying shares of Class A common stock. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying shares of Class A common stock for sale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, we may redeem the warrants as set forth above even if the holders are otherwise unable to exercise their warrants. The grant of registration rights to our initial stockholders and holders of our Private Placement Warrants may make it more difficult to complete our initial business combination, and the future exercise of such rights may adversely affect the market price of our shares of Class A common stock. Our initial stockholders and their permitted transferees can demand that we register the shares of Class A common stock into which Founder Shares are convertible, holders of our Private Placement Warrants and their permitted transferees can demand that we register the Private Placement Warrants and the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Warrants and holders of warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans may demand that we register such warrants or the Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of such warrants. The registration rights will be exercisable with respect to the Founder Shares and the Private Placement Warrants and the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of such Private Placement Warrants. We will bear the cost of registering these securities. The registration and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, the existence of the registration rights may make our initial business combination more costly or difficult to conclude. This is because the stockholders of the target business may increase the equity stake they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on the market price of our Class A common stock that is expected when the shares of common stock owned by our initial stockholders, holders of our Private Placement Warrants or holders of our working capital loans or their respective permitted transferees are registered. We may issue additional shares of Class A common stock or shares of preferred stock to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial business combination. We may also issue shares of Class A common stock upon the conversion of the Founder Shares at a ratio greater than one-to-one at the time of our initial business combination as a result of the anti-dilution provisions contained in our Charter.

Our warrants will be issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of public warrants. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the public warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the public warrants with the consent of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, convert the warrants into cash or stock (at a ratio different than initially provided), shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of shares of Class A common stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant.

We will waive any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and that such courts represent an inconvenient forum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, these provisions of the warrant agreement will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our warrants shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions in our warrant agreement.

This choice-of-forum provision may limit a warrant holder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with our company, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our warrant agreement inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors.

None of the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by our sponsor or its permitted transferees. Our warrants and Founder Shares may have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares of Class A common stock and make it more difficult to effectuate our initial business combination. We issued warrants to purchase 11,500,000 shares of our Class A common stock, as part of the units offered in the Public Offering and, simultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering, we issued in a private placement an aggregate of 11,700,000 Private Placement Warrants, each exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock at $11.50 per share. Our initial stockholders currently own an aggregate of 5,750,000 Founder Shares. The Founder Shares are convertible into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment as set forth in the prospectus relating to the Public Offering. In addition, if our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors make any working capital loans, such lender may convert those loans into up to an additional 1,500,000 Private Placement Warrants, at the price of $1.00 per warrant. Our sponsor has loaned us $2,780,000 as of March 27, 2023 through our issuance of the Original Note to the sponsor in the principal amount of $2,300,000 on December 28, 2022 and our issuance of the Second Note to the sponsor in the principal amount of $480,000 on March 27, 2023. The Original Note was issued in connection with extending our Termination Date from December 28, 2022 to March 28, 2023 and the Second Note was issued in connection with extending our Termination Date from March 28, 2023 to June 28, 2023. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into Private Placement Warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. Such warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. To the extent we issue shares of Class A common stock for any reason, including to effectuate a business combination, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares of Class A common stock upon exercise of these warrants and conversion rights could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business. Such warrants, when exercised, will increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock and reduce the value of the Class A common stock issued to complete the business combination. Therefore, our warrants and Founder Shares may make it more difficult to effectuate a business transaction or increase the cost of acquiring the target business. You will not be permitted to exercise your warrants unless we register and qualify the underlying Class A common stock or certain exemptions are available. If the issuance of the Class A common stock upon exercise of the warrants is not registered, qualified or exempt from registration or qualification under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, holders of warrants will not be entitled to exercise such warrants and such warrants may have no value and expire worthless.

We may issue our shares to investors in connection with our initial business combination at a price that is less than the prevailing market price of our shares at that time. In connection with our initial business combination, we may issue shares to investors in private placement transactions (so-called PIPE transactions) at a price of $10.00 per share or which approximates the per-share amounts in our Trust Account at such time, which is generally approximately $10.00. The purpose of such issuances will be to enable us to provide sufficient liquidity to the post-business combination entity. The price of the shares we issue may therefore be less, and potentially significantly less, than the market price for our shares at such time. Our warrants are accounted for as a warrant liability and were recorded at fair value upon issuance with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A common stock or may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination. In connection with the Public Offering and the concurrent private placement of warrants, we issued an aggregate of 23,200,000 warrants (comprised of the 11,500,000 warrants included in the units and the 11,700,000 Private Placement Warrants). We currently account for these as a warrant liability and will record at fair value upon issuance any changes in fair value each period reported in earnings as determined by us based upon a valuation report obtained from an independent third party valuation firm. The impact of changes in fair value on earnings may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, potential targets may seek a SPAC that does not have warrants that are accounted for as a warrant liability, which may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination with a target business. 51",

Our sponsor invested in us an aggregate of $11,725,000, comprised of the $25,000 purchase price for the Founder Shares and the $11,700,000 purchase price for the Private Placement Warrants. Assuming a trading price of $10.00 per share upon consummation of our initial business combination, the 5,750,000 Founder Shares would have an aggregate implied value of $57,500,000. Even if the trading price of our common stock was as low as approximately $2.04 per share, and the Private Placement Warrants were worthless, the value of the Founder Shares would be equal to the sponsor\u2019s initial investment in us. As a result, our sponsor is likely to be able to recoup its investment in us and make a substantial profit on that investment, even if our public shares have lost significant value. Accordingly, our management team, which owns interests in our sponsor, may have an economic incentive that differs from that of the public stockholders to pursue and consummate an initial business combination rather than to liquidate and to return all of the cash in the trust to the public stockholders, even if that business combination were with a riskier or less-established target business. For the foregoing reasons, you should consider our management team\u2019s financial incentive to complete an initial business combination when evaluating whether to redeem your shares prior to or in connection with the initial business combination. General Risk Factors We are a blank check company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective. We are a blank check company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware with no operating results. Because we lack an operating history, you have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective of completing our initial business combination. We have no plans, arrangements or understandings with any prospective target business concerning a business combination and may be unable to complete our initial business combination. If we fail to complete our initial business combination, we will never generate any operating revenues. The SEC has recently issued final rules relating to certain activities of SPACs. Certain of the procedures that the Company or others may determine to undertake in connection with such rules may increase our costs and the time needed to complete the Business Combination. On January 24, 2024, the SEC issued final rules (the \u201c2024 SPAC Rules\u201d), effective no sooner than 125 days following the publication of the 2024 SPAC Rules in the Federal Register, that formally adopted some of the SEC\u2019s proposed rules for SPACs that were released on March 30, 2022. The 2024 SPAC Rules, among other items, impose additional disclosure requirements in initial public offerings by SPACs and business combination transactions involving SPACs and private operating companies; amend the financial statement requirements applicable to business combination transactions involving such companies; update and expand guidance regarding the general use of projections in SEC filings, including requiring disclosure of all material bases of the projections and all material assumptions underlying the projections; increase the potential liability of certain participants in proposed business combination transactions; and could impact the extent to which SPACs could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act. In the event that the Business Combination has not been consummated by the time the 2024 SPAC Rules become effective, such rules may materially adversely affect our business, including our ability to complete, and the costs associated with, the Business Combination, and results of operations. If we are deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we would be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities would be severely restricted. As a result, in such circumstances, unless we are able to modify our activities so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we may abandon our efforts to complete the Business Combination and instead liquidate the Company. 53",

The 2024 SPAC Rules would provide a safe harbor for such companies from the definition of \u201cinvestment company\u201d under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act, provided that a SPAC satisfies certain criteria, including a limited time period to announce and complete a de-SPAC transaction. Specifically, to comply with the safe harbor, the 2024 SPAC Rules would require a company to file a report on Form 8-K announcing that it has entered into an agreement with a target company for a business combination no later than 18 months after the effective date of its registration statement for its initial public offering (the \u201cIPO Registration Statement\u201d). The Company would then be required to complete its initial business combination no later than the 24-month anniversary of the closing of the Public Offering. If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, our activities would be severely restricted. In addition, we would be subject to burdensome compliance requirements. We do not believe that our principal activities will subject us to regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. However, if we are deemed to be an investment company and subject to compliance with and regulation under the Investment Company Act, we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and expenses for which we have not allotted funds. As a result, unless we are able to modify our activities so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we may abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead liquidate the Company. Were we to liquidate, our warrants would expire worthless, and our securityholders would lose the investment opportunity associated with an investment in the combined company, including any potential price appreciation of our securities. To mitigate the risk that we might be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we have liquidated the investments held in the Trust Account and instead the funds are held in the Trust Account in cash items until the earlier of the consummation of our initial business combination or our liquidation. Following the liquidation of investments in the Trust Account, we have received minimal interest on the funds held in the Trust Account, which has reduced the dollar amount our Public Stockholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company. Initially, the funds in the Trust Account had, since the Public Offering, been held only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. government treasury obligations and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. However, to mitigate the risk of us being deemed to be an unregistered investment company (including under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act) and thus subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, we liquidated the U.S. government treasury obligations or money market funds held in the Trust Account and instructed Continental to maintain the funds in the Trust Account in cash in an interest-bearing demand deposit account at a bank until the earlier of the consummation of our initial business combination or the liquidation of the Company. Interest on such deposit account is currently approximately 3.5-4.0% per annum, but such deposit account carries a variable rate and the Company cannot assure you that such rate will not decrease or increase significantly. Following such liquidation, we have received minimal interest on the funds held in the Trust Account. However, interest previously earned on the funds held in the Trust Account still may be released to us to pay our taxes, if any. As a result, the decision to hold all funds in the Trust Account in cash items has reduced the dollar amount our Public Stockholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company. In the adopting release for the 2024 SPAC Rules, the SEC provided guidance that a SPAC\u2019s potential status as an \u201cinvestment company\u201d depends on a variety of factors, such as a SPAC\u2019s duration, asset composition, business purpose and activities and \u201cis a question of facts and circumstances\u201d requiring individualized analysis. If we were deemed to be subject to compliance with and regulation under the Investment Company Act, we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and expenses for which we have not allotted funds. Unless we are able to modify our activities so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we would either register as an investment company or wind down and abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead to liquidate the Company. 54",

We are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor internal controls attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile. Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. Additionally, we are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30th, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible. Provisions in our Charter and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our shares of Class A common stock and could entrench management. Our Charter contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include a staggered board of directors and the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock, which may make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together these provisions may make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. 55",

Our Charter requires, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, that (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us, our directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our Charter or bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us, our directors, officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware, except any action (A) as to which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction, or (D) arising under the Securities Act, as to which the Court of Chancery and the federal district court for the District of Delaware shall concurrently be the sole and exclusive forums. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this paragraph will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America have exclusive jurisdiction. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our Charter. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims, although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our Charter to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Our Charter provides that the exclusive forum provision will be applicable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, and Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Cyber incidents or attacks directed at us could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss. We depend on digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications and services, including those of third parties with which we may deal. Sophisticated and deliberate attacks on, or security breaches in, our systems or infrastructure, or the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud, could lead to corruption or misappropriation of our assets, proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. As an early stage company without significant investments in data security protection, we may not be sufficiently protected against such occurrences. We may not have sufficient resources to adequately protect against, or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to, cyber incidents. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have adverse consequences on our business and lead to financial loss. 56",

Our underwriters are entitled to receive deferred commissions that will be released from the Trust Account only on a completion of an initial business combination. These financial incentives may cause them to have potential conflicts of interest in rendering any such additional services to us after the Public Offering, including, for example, in connection with the sourcing and consummation of an initial business combination. We may engage one or more of our underwriters or one of their respective affiliates to provide additional services to us after the Public Offering, including, for example, identifying potential targets, providing financial advisory services, acting as a placement agent in a private offering or arranging debt financing. We may pay such underwriter or its affiliate fair and reasonable fees or other compensation that would be determined at that time in an arm\u2019s length negotiation; provided that no agreement will be entered into with any of the underwriters or their respective affiliates and no fees or other compensation for such services will be paid to any of the underwriters or their respective affiliates prior to the date that is 60 days from the date of the prospectus related to the Public Offering, unless such payment would not be deemed underwriters\u2019 compensation in connection with the Public Offering. The underwriters are also entitled to receive deferred commissions that are conditioned on the completion of an initial business combination. The underwriters\u2019 or their respective affiliates\u2019 financial interests tied to the consummation of a business combination transaction may give rise to potential conflicts of interest in providing any such additional services to us, including potential conflicts of interest in connection with the sourcing and consummation of an initial business combination. We depend on a variety of U.S. and multi-national financial institutions to provide us with banking services. The default or failure of one or more of the financial institutions that we rely on may adversely affect our business and financial condition. We maintain the majority of our cash and cash equivalents in accounts with major U.S. and multi-national financial institutions, and our deposits at certain of these institutions exceed insured limits. Market conditions can impact the viability of these institutions. In the event of the failure of any of the financial institutions where we maintain our cash and cash equivalents, there can be no assurance that we would be able to access uninsured funds in a timely manner or at all. Any inability to access or delay in accessing these funds could adversely affect our liquidity, business and financial condition. We may be subject to the 1% excise tax included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which may decrease the value of our securities following our initial business combination and hinder our ability to consummate an initial business combination. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the \u201cIR Act\u201d) was signed into law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal 1% excise tax on certain repurchases (including redemptions and economically similar transactions) of stock by publicly traded U.S. corporations on or after January 1, 2023. Because we are a Delaware corporation and our securities are trading on NYSE, we are a \u201ccovered corporation\u201d within the meaning of the IR Act. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its stockholders from which shares are repurchased (although it may reduce the amount of cash distributable in a current or subsequent redemption). The amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased, determined at the time of the repurchase. Corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances by such corporation against the fair market value of stock repurchases (or deemed repurchases) during the same taxable year to reduce or eliminate the amount of excise tax that would otherwise apply. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the \u201cTreasury\u201d) has authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out, and prevent the abuse or avoidance of, the excise tax. On December 27, 2022, the Treasury published Notice 2023-2 as interim guidance until the publication of forthcoming proposed regulations on the excise tax. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether, and/or to what extent, the excise tax could apply to redemptions of our stock, including any redemptions in connection with a business combination, or in the event we do not consummate a business combination. 57",

For each monthly extension of the Charter Extension Date we will deposit $160,000 into the Trust Account. In connection with the vote of our stockholders on March 24, 2023 to extend our Termination Date, the holders of 17,404,506 Class A common stock of the Company properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for an aggregate price of approximately $10.48 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of $182,460,110. After the satisfaction of such redemptions, the balance in our trust account was $58,660,352 (including interest not previously released to the Company but net of expected franchise and income taxes payable). On March 28, 2024 the Company\u2019s stockholders voted to amend the Company\u2019s Charter to extend the date (the \u201cTermination Date\u201d) by which the Company has to consummate a Business Combination (the \u201cCharter Extension\u201d) from March 28, 2024 to April 28, 2024 and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date to consummate a Business Combination on a monthly basis up to eleven times by an additional one month each time after the Charter Extension Date, by resolution of the Company\u2019s board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d), if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days\u2019 advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until March 28, 2025 (each, an \u201cAdditional Charter Extension Date\u201d) or a total of up to twelve months after the Original Termination Date, unless the closing of a Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto (the \u201cExtension Amendment Proposal\u201d).

Exclusivity Each of the Company, PubCo, IndiaCo, Hunch Mobility and Merger Sub has agreed that from the date of the Business Combination Agreement to the earlier of the closing of the Merger and the termination of the Business Combination Agreement, no party will: (i) solicit, initiate, encourage (including by means of furnishing or disclosing information), knowingly facilitate (including by commencing due diligence), discuss or negotiate, directly or indirectly, any inquiry, proposal or offer (written or oral) with respect to an alternative transaction, (ii) furnish or disclose any non-public information to any person in connection with, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, an alternative transaction, (iii) enter into any contract or other arrangement or understanding regarding an alternative transaction, (iv) make any filings with the SEC in connection with a public offering of any equity securities or other securities of the Blade Group (or any affiliate or successor of the Blade Group) or (v) otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in, or knowingly facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any person (other than the Principal Shareholders and the Blade Group) to do or seek to do any of the foregoing or seek to circumvent such covenant or further any alternative transaction. Conditions to Closing Mutual Conditions The obligations of the parties to the Business Combination Agreement to consummate the Transactions are conditioned upon the following mutual conditions: a) the absence of any law or other legal restraint or prohibition issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental authority preventing the consummation of the Transactions; b) the effectiveness under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), of the Registration Statement/Proxy Statement and that no stop order will have been issued by the SEC and remain in effect with respect to the Registration Statement/Proxy Statement; 63",

Within twenty-four (24) hours of the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, or at such other time and place upon which the parties shall agree in writing (the \u201cInitial Closing Date\u201d), PubCo shall execute and deliver a Convertible Note with an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 to the Holder, which is automatically convertible into 100,000 PubCo Preferred Shares upon the Effective Time (the \u201cInitial Convertible Note\u201d). Following the Initial Closing Date, PubCo shall execute and deliver, and the Holder shall fund, two additional Convertible Notes in two monthly installments at subsequent closings (each an \u201cInstallment Closing\u201d). The two Installment Closings shall be held: (i) on the day one (1) month following the Initial Closing Date and (ii) on the day two (2) months following the Initial Closing Date, at such time and place as shall be approved by PubCo and the Holder, with an additional aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000 on the same terms and conditions as those contained in the Initial Convertible Note. The PubCo Preferred Shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, pursuant to their terms, shall be convertible into PubCo Class A Ordinary Shares. Interest shall accrue on the unpaid principal balance of each Convertible Note, together with any interest accrued but unpaid thereon (the \u201cOutstanding Amount\u201d), at an annual rate equal to 10% per annum, until the Outstanding Amount is paid or the closing of the Business Combination. Each Convertible Note\u2019s first interest payment date will be the first three-month anniversary of the date of each respective Convertible Note. Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, the proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Notes will be used: (i) up to $750,000 solely for working capital purposes for the operation of IndiaCo\u2019s business, (ii) the remaining aggregate proceeds of the Convertible Notes other than the proceeds used in accordance with clause (i) solely for the acquisition of aircraft and (iii) in each case of clauses (i) and (ii) in compliance with all applicable laws. The Outstanding Amount of each Convertible Note shall be automatically due and payable in full on the date that is the earlier of (1) three (3) business days following the termination of the Business Combination Agreement and (2) 363 days from the date of issuance of each respective Convertible Note (as applicable, the \u201cMaturity Date\u201d). If PubCo fails to pay any amount due pursuant to each Convertible Note within five business days of each respective Maturity Date, interest shall accrue at the rate of 17% per annum on the Outstanding Amount until the entire Outstanding Amount is paid in full. Investor Subscription Agreement Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company entered into a subscription agreement (the \u201cInvestor Subscription Agreement\u201d) with Investor. Pursuant to the Investor Subscription Agreement, Investor agreed to subscribe for and purchase, and the Company agreed to issue and sell to Investor, immediately prior to the Closing, an aggregate of 700,000 DSAQ Preferred Shares for a purchase price of $10.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $7,000,000. The closing of the Investor Subscription Agreement will be conditioned on (i) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Hunch Subscription Agreement and (ii) the consummation of additional investments in an aggregate investment amount of $12,000,000 (\u201cMinimum Additional Investment\u201d), for DSAQ Preferred Shares, DSAQ Class A Shares, PubCo Preferred Shares or PubCo Ordinary Shares, issued to investors (the \u201cAdditional Investors\u201d), on terms and conditions that are not materially more advantageous to any such Additional Investors than Investor hereunder, unless such terms and conditions are consented to by Investor. For avoidance of doubt, the Minimum Additional Investment shall not include any investments pursuant to the Investor Subscription Agreement, the acquisition of the Retained Shares (as defined the Investor Subscription Agreement) or the Hunch Subscription Agreement. The Investor Subscription Agreement contains customary conditions to closing, including, among other things, the consummation of the Business Combination.

Each CVR I represents the right of the holder thereof to receive its pro rata share of 2,000,000 newly issued PubCo Class A Ordinary Shares, and each CVR I shall be exercised automatically upon PubCo\u2019s delivery of the CVR Payment Notice (as defined in the CVR Agreement) to the Rights Agent, notifying the Rights Agent that, during the 12 month period ending on the final day of the month in which the second anniversary of the Closing occurs, the consolidated revenues of PubCo and its subsidiaries was less than $50 million. Each CVR II represents the right of the holder thereof to receive its pro rata share of 2,000,000 newly issued PubCo Class A Ordinary Shares, and each CVR II shall be exercised automatically upon PubCo\u2019s delivery of the CVR Payment Notice to the Rights Agent, notifying the Rights Agent that, during the 12 month period ending on the final day of the month in which the third anniversary of the Closing occurs, the consolidated revenues of PubCo and its subsidiaries was less than $142 million. Each CVR III represents the right of the holder thereof to receive its pro rata share of 2,000,000 newly issued PubCo Class A Ordinary Shares, and each CVR III shall be exercised automatically upon PubCo\u2019s delivery of the CVR Payment Notice, notifying the Rights Agent that, during the 12 month period ending on the final day of the month in which the fourth anniversary of the Closing occurs, the consolidated revenues of PubCo and its subsidiaries was less than $263 million. The contingent payments under the CVR Agreement, if they become payable, will become payable to the Rights Agent for subsequent distribution to the holders of the CVRs. There can be no assurance that any payment of any PubCo Ordinary Shares will be made or that any holders of CVRs will receive any amounts with respect thereto. The right to the contingent payments contemplated by the CVR Agreement is a contractual right only. The CVRs will not be evidenced by a certificate or other instrument. The CVRs will not be transferable. The CVRs will not have any voting or dividend rights and will not represent any equity or ownership interest in PubCo or any of its affiliates. No interest will accrue on any amounts payable in respect of the CVRs. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2023, we had $467,309 in our operating bank account and working capital deficit of $10,679,799. The Company has entered into promissory notes and working capital loans with the Sponsor for a total of $6,155,985. These Notes bear no interest and are due upon liquidation or consummation of an initial Business Combination. If the Company completes an initial Business Combination, the Company would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that the initial Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from the Trust Account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. As of the date of this filing, the Company has until April 28, 2024, unless otherwise extended pursuant to the Charter and with a monthly additional deposit of $160,000 to the Trust Account, to consummate an initial Business Combination. It is uncertain that we will be able to consummate an initial business combination within 12 months from the issuance date of these financial statements or obtain additional funding. If an initial Business Combination is not consummated by the required date of April 28, 2024, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. In the event of a dissolution, we anticipate a shortfall of liquidity. Our anticipated shortfall of sufficient liquidity to meet our current and future estimated financial obligations raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within one year after the date that the accompanying financial statements are issued. We plan to address this uncertainty through loans and through consummation of our initial Business Combination. There is no assurance that loans will be available to us or that our plans to consummate an initial Business Combination will be successful. 67",

            "context": "Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2023, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Risks and Uncertainties Various social and political circumstances in the U.S. and around the world (including wars and other forms of conflict, rising trade tensions between the United States and China, and other uncertainties regarding actual and potential shifts in the U.S. and foreign trade, economic and other policies with other countries, terrorist acts, security operations and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and global health epidemics), may also contribute to increased market volatility and economic uncertainties or deterioration in the U.S. and worldwide. Specifically, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and resulting market volatility could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to complete a Business Combination. In response to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S. and other countries have imposed sanctions or other restrictive actions against Russia. Any of the above factors, including sanctions, export controls, tariffs, trade wars and other governmental actions, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to complete a Business Combination and the value of the Company\u2019s securities. In addition, we depend on a variety of U.S. and multi-national financial institutions to provide us with banking services. The default or failure of one or more of the financial institutions that we rely on may adversely affect our business and financial condition, including our ability to successfully consummate a Business Combination. We maintain the majority of our cash and cash equivalents in accounts with major U.S. and multi-national financial institutions, and our deposits at certain of these institutions exceed insured limits. Market conditions can impact the viability of these institutions. In the event of the failure of any of the financial institutions where we maintain our cash and cash equivalents, there can be no assurance that we would be able to access uninsured funds in a timely manner or at all. Any inability to access or delay in accessing these funds could adversely affect our liquidity, business and financial condition. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the \u201cIR Act\u201d) was signed into law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal 1% excise tax on certain repurchases (including redemptions and economically similar transactions) of stock by publicly traded U.S. corporations on or after January 1, 2023. Because we are a Delaware corporation and our securities are trading on the New York Stock Exchange, we are a \u201ccovered corporation\u201d within the meaning of the IR Act. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its stockholders from which shares are repurchased (although it may reduce the amount of cash distributable in a current or subsequent redemption). The amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased, determined at the time of the repurchase. Corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances by such corporation against the fair market value of stock repurchases (or deemed repurchases) during the same taxable year to reduce or eliminate the amount of excise tax that would otherwise apply. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the \u201cTreasury\u201d) has authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out, and prevent the abuse or avoidance of, the excise tax. Whether and to what extent we would be subject to the excise tax will depend on a number of factors, including (i) whether the redemption is treated as a repurchase of stock for purposes of the excise tax, (ii) the fair market value of the redemptions treated as repurchases in connection with a Business Combination, (iii) the structure of a Business Combination and whether any such transaction closes, (iv) the nature and amount of any private investment in public equity (\u201cPIPE\u201d) or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of a Business Combination), (v) whether we consummate a Business Combination, and (vi) the content of regulations and other guidance issued by the Treasury. It is possible that the Company will be subject to the excise tax with respect to any subsequent redemptions, including redemptions in connection with a Business Combination, that 68",

As mentioned, the excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not the stockholders from which stock is repurchased. The imposition of the excise tax (including as a result of holders of public shares electing to exercise their redemption rights in connection with a Business Combination) could, however, reduce the amount of cash available to the Company to pay redemptions (or the cash contribution to the target business in connection with a Business combination, which could hinder the Company\u2019s ability to complete a Business Combination or cause the other shareholders of the combined company to economically bear the impact of such excise tax).

We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial Business Combination, at the earliest. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds derived from the Public Offering. We expect to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we had net loss of $269,906, which consisted of operating costs amounting to $4,691,195 and provision for income tax of $936,959, partially offset by interest earned on cash and investments held in Trust Account of $4,620,033 and the Company\u2019s operating bank interest income of $42,215, and $696,000 of a change in fair value of warrant liability.

Contractual Obligations We do not have any long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, purchase obligations or long-term liabilities. Administrative Services Agreement We have agreed to pay our Sponsor $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support services. Upon the earlier of the completion of the initial Business Combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying such monthly fees. For the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, $120,000 was incurred for the administrative service fee.

The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain \u201cpiggy-back\u201d registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the Company\u2019s completion of the initial Business Combination. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.

The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company\u2019s management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and, therefore, actual results could differ from our estimates. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We have identified the following critical accounting estimates: Warrant Liability and Working Capital Loan Conversion Option We classify each warrant and the Working Capital Loan Option as a liability at its fair value. These liabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement, the liabilities will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in our statement of operations.

Opinion on the financial statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Direct Selling Acquisition Corp. (a Delaware corporation) (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders\u2019 deficit, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company\u2019s business plan is dependent on obtaining additional working capital loans from the sponsor and the completion of a business combination. The Company\u2019s cash and working capital as of December 31, 2023, are not sufficient to complete its planned activities for the upcoming year. These conditions, along with other matters set forth in Note 1, raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Management\u2019s plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 1 to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. GRANT THORNTON LLP We have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2021. Southfield, Michigan April 1, 2024 74",

(the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation on March 9, 2021 , for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar Business Combination with one or more businesses (the \u201cBusiness Combination\u201d). The Company may pursue an initial Business Combination target in any business or industry. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had not commenced operations. All activity for the period from March 9, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2023 relates to the Company\u2019s formation and the initial public offering (the \u201cPublic Offering\u201d) and, subsequent to the Public Offering, identifying a target company for a Business Combination and completion of the proposed Business Combination (described below). The Company will not generate operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Public Offering. The Company\u2019s Sponsor is DSAC Partners LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the \u201cSponsor\u201d). On September 28, 2021, the Company consummated its Public Offering of 23,000,000 units (the \u201cUnits\u201d and with respect to the Class A common stock included in the Units sold, the \u201cPublic Shares\u201d). Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $ 0.0001 per share (the \u201cClass A Common Stock\u201d), and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (each whole warrant, a \u201cPublic Warrant\u201d), with each Public Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $ 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The Units were sold at a price of $ 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $ 230,000,000 . Simultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering, pursuant to the Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement, the Company completed the private sale of 11,700,000 warrants (the \u201cPrivate Placement Warrants\u201d) to the Sponsor at a purchase price of $ 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $ 11,700,000 . The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants included as part of the Units sold in the Public Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants, so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, (i) are not redeemable by the Company, (ii) may not (including the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants), subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold until 30 days after the completion of the Company\u2019s initial Business Combination, (iii) may be exercised on a cashless basis and (iv) are entitled to registration rights. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sale. The issuance of the Private Placement Warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), as amended. The Business Combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 % of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting commissions held in trust) at the time of signing the agreement to enter into the Business Combination. However, the Company will only complete such Business Combination if the post transaction company owns or acquires 50 % or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d). There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. Upon the closing of the Public Offering, $ 10.20 per Unit sold in the Public Offering, including the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, is held in a Trust Account and invested only in U.S. government securities with a maturity of 180 days or less, in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a- 79 7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations or in demand deposit accounts. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company to pay its taxes, the proceeds from the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants will not be released from the Trust Account until the earliest of (i) the completion of the initial Business Combination, (ii) the redemption of the public shares if the Company is unable to complete the initial Business Combination by the Termination Date, subject to applicable law, and (iii) the redemption of the public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (\u201cCharter\u201d) to modify the substance or timing of the Company\u2019s obligation to redeem 100 % of the public shares if the Company has not consummated an initial Business Combination by the Termination Date or with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders\u2019 rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject to the claims of the Company\u2019s creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of the Company\u2019s public stockholders. The Company will provide its public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of the initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) without a stockholder vote by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a proposed Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in the Company\u2019s discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require the Company to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements. The Company will provide its public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of the initial Business Combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and less up to $ 100,000 to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations and on the conditions described herein. 80",

With the December 28, 2022 deposit into the Trust Account for a three-month extension of $ 2,300,000 ($ 0.10 per share), the Company had 18 months (or March 28, 2023) from the closing of the Public Offering, or any extended period of time that the Company may have, to consummate an initial Business Combination as a result of an amendment to the Company\u2019s Charter (the \u201cCombination Period\u201d) to complete the initial Business Combination. If the Company is unable to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at aper-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and less up to $ 100,000 to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders\u2019 rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company\u2019s remaining stockholders and the Company\u2019s board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in each case, to the Company\u2019s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete its initial Business Combination within the Combination Period. On March 24, 2023 the Company\u2019s stockholders voted to amend the Company\u2019s Charter to extend the date (the \u201cTermination Date\u201d) by which the Company has to consummate a Business Combination (the \u201cCharter Extension\u201d) from March 28, 2023 (the \u201cOriginal Termination Date\u201d) to June 28, 2023 (the \u201cCharter Extension Date\u201d) and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to elect to extend the Termination Date to consummate a Business Combination on a monthly basis up to nine times by an additional one month each time after the Charter Extension Date, by resolution of the Company\u2019s board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d), if requested by the Sponsor, and upon five days\u2019 advance notice prior to the applicable Termination Date, until March 28, 2024 (each, an \u201cAdditional Charter Extension Date\u201d) or a total of up to twelve months after the Original Termination Date, unless the closing of a Business Combination shall have occurred prior thereto (the \u201cExtension Amendment Proposal\u201d). For each monthly extension of the Charter Extension Date the Company will deposit $ 160,000 into the Trust Account. In connection with the Company\u2019s stockholders\u2019 vote on March 24, 2023, the holders of 17,404,506 Class A common stock of the Company properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for an aggregate price of approximately $ 10.48 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of $ 182,460,109 . After the satisfaction of such redemptions, the balance in the Company\u2019s Trust Account was approximately $ 58,660,352 (including interest not previously released to the Company but net of expected franchise and income taxes payable). For the year ended December 31, 2023, $ 1,600,000 has been deposited in the Trust Account to extend the Termination Date to January 28, 2024.In the period from January 2024 to March 2024 an aggregate of $ 480,000 was deposited in the Trust Account, extending the Combination Period to April 28, 2024. The initial stockholders, Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with the Company, pursuant to which they have agreed to (i) waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and Public Shares they hold in connection with the completion of the initial Business Combination, (ii) waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and Public Shares they hold in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to the Company\u2019s Charter to modify the substance or timing of the Company\u2019s obligation to redeem 100 % of the Public Shares if the Company has not consummated an initial Business Combination within the Combination Period or with respect to any other material provisions relating 81 to stockholders\u2019 rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity and (iii) waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any founder shares they hold if the Company fails to complete its initial Business Combination within the Combination Period or any extended period of time that the Company may have to consummate an initial Business Combination as a result of an amendment to the Company\u2019s Charter (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares they hold if the Company fails to complete its initial Business Combination within the prescribed time frame) and (iv) vote any founder shares held by them and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Public Offering (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of the initial Business Combination. The Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or Business Combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $ 10.20 per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $ 10.20 per Public Share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor did it apply to any claims under the Company\u2019s indemnity of the underwriters of the Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, the Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and the Company believes that the Sponsor\u2019s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot assure you that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. Proposed Business Combination On January 17, 2024, the Company, entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the \u201cBusiness Combination Agreement\u201d), by and among Aeroflow Urban Air Mobility Private Limited, a private limited company incorporated under the laws of India and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of PubCo (\u201cIndiaCo\u201d), Hunch Technologies Limited, a private limited company incorporated in Ireland with registered number 607449 (\u201cPubCo\u201d), FlyBlade (India) Private Limited, a private limited company incorporated under the laws of India (\u201cHunch Mobility\u201d), and HTL Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of PubCo (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d).

The Merger and the Transactions were unanimously approved by the board of directors of the Company on January 17, 2024. The Business Combination Agreement Reorganization Transactions Prior to the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, PubCo, IndiaCo and Hunch Mobility consummated a series of reorganization transactions pursuant to which, among other things, Hunch Mobility transferred all of its assets and liabilities (other than certain excluded assets and liabilities) to IndiaCo on a slump sale basis as a going concern. In connection with the Merger, prior to the closing of the Transactions (the \u201cClosing\u201d), PubCo will complete a reorganization (such transactions, the \u201cPre-Closing Reorganization\u201d), pursuant to which, among other things, (i) after receipt of applicable governmental and regulatory consents, Hunch Mobility shall transfer all of the equity securities of Transhermes Aero IFSC Private Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hunch Mobility 82",

Each unit of the Company issued in the IPO that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be automatically separated and the holder thereof will be deemed to hold one (1) DSAQ Class A Share and one-half (1/2) of a public warrant of the Company, which underlying securities will be converted as described above. At the Effective Time, unless otherwise amended by the DSAQ Warrant Amendment, without any further action, each warrant of the Company that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding but shall be assumed by PubCo and automatically adjusted to become (A) with respect to each public warrant of the Company, one (1) public warrant of PubCo and (B) with respect to each private placement warrant of the Company, one (1) private placement warrant of PubCo, each of which shall be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions applicable prior to such conversion; except that each such warrant shall be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for (i) one (1) PubCo Class A Ordinary Share, (ii) one (1) CVR I, (iii) one (1) CVR II and (iv) one (1) CVR III, in lieu of DSAQ Class A Shares (subject to the PubCo warrant agreement). If the DSAQ Warrant Amendment is approved, then immediately prior to the Effective Time, each warrant of the Company will automatically convert into one-fifth (1/5) of one DSAQ Class A Share (with no fractional shares being issued if less than five (5) warrants are held ). Registration Statement/Proxy Statement In connection with the Transactions, the Company and PubCo will prepare and file a registration statement on Form F-4 (the \u201cRegistration Statement/Proxy Statement\u201d) with the SEC, which will include a prospectus of PubCo and a proxy statement/prospectus for the Company\u2019s stockholder meeting to solicit the vote of the Company\u2019s stockholders to, among other things, adopt the Business Combination Agreement and approve the Transactions. 83 In addition, as promptly as practicable following the time at which the Registration Statement/Proxy Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, the Company will solicit the vote or consent of registered holders of warrants of the Company to adopt and approve an amendment to the Company\u2019s warrant agreement to provide that, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, each warrant of the Company will automatically convert into one-fifth (1/5) of one DSAQ Class A Share (with no fractional shares being issued if less than five (5) warrants are held). Representations, Warranties and Covenants The parties to the Business Combination Agreement have made representations, warranties and covenants that are customary for transactions of this nature. The representations and warranties of the respective parties to the Business Combination Agreement will not survive the Closing. The covenants of the respective parties to the Business Combination Agreement will also not survive the Closing, except for those covenants that by their terms expressly apply in whole or in part after the Closing. In connection with the foregoing, the Company, through its board of directors, shall recommend to the Company\u2019s stockholders and warrant holders the adoption and approval of the Business Combination Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (including the Merger), and the approval and adoption of the DSAQ Warrant Amendment, respectively. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior to obtaining the requisite approval of the Company\u2019s stockholders with respect to the Business Combination, the Company\u2019s board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that a Blade Group Material Adverse Effect has occurred on or after the date of the Business Combination Agreement and, as a result, the failure to change its recommendation would be inconsistent with the board of directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under applicable law, the Company\u2019s board of directors may effect a change of recommendation, subject to certain conditions. Exclusivity Each of the Company, PubCo, IndiaCo, Hunch Mobility and Merger Sub has agreed that from the date of the Business Combination Agreement to the earlier of the closing of the Merger and the termination of the Business Combination Agreement, no party will: (i) solicit, initiate, encourage (including by means of furnishing or disclosing information), knowingly facilitate (including by commencing due diligence), discuss or negotiate, directly or indirectly, any inquiry, proposal or offer (written or oral) with respect to an alternative transaction, (ii) furnish or disclose any non-public information to any person in connection with, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, an alternative transaction, (iii) enter into any contract or other arrangement or understanding regarding an alternative transaction, (iv) make any filings with the SEC in connection with a public offering of any equity securities or other securities of the Blade Group (or any affiliate or successor of the Blade Group) or (v) otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in, or knowingly facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any person (other than the Principal Shareholders and the Blade Group) to do or seek to do any of the foregoing or seek to circumvent such covenant or further any alternative transaction. Conditions to Closing Mutual Conditions The obligations of the parties to the Business Combination Agreement to consummate the Transactions are conditioned upon the following mutual conditions: a) the absence of any law or other legal restraint or prohibition issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental authority preventing the consummation of the Transactions; 84",

Within twenty-four (24) hours of the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, or at such other time and place upon which the parties shall agree in writing (the \u201cInitial Closing Date\u201d), PubCo shall execute and deliver a Convertible Note with an aggregate principal amount of $ 1,000,000 to the Holder, which is automatically convertible into 100,000 PubCo Preferred Shares upon the Effective Time (the \u201cInitial Convertible Note\u201d). Following the Initial Closing Date, PubCo shall execute and deliver, and the Holder shall fund, two additional Convertible Notes in two monthly installments at subsequent closings (each an \u201cInstallment Closing\u201d). The two Installment Closings shall be held: (i) on the day one (1) month following the Initial Closing Date and (ii) on the day two (2) months following the Initial Closing Date, at such time and place as shall be approved by PubCo and the Holder, with an additional aggregate principal amount of $ 2,000,000 on the same terms and conditions as those contained in the Initial Convertible Note. The PubCo Preferred Shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, pursuant to their terms, shall be convertible into PubCo Class A Ordinary Shares. Interest shall accrue on the unpaid principal balance of each Convertible Note, together with any interest accrued but unpaid thereon (the \u201cOutstanding Amount\u201d), at an annual rate equal to 10 % per annum, until the Outstanding Amount is paid or the closing of the Business Combination. Each Convertible Note\u2019s first interest payment date will be the first three-month anniversary of the date of each respective Convertible Note. Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, the proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Notes will be used: (i) up to $ 750,000 solely for working capital purposes for the operation of IndiaCo\u2019s business, (ii) the remaining aggregate proceeds of the Convertible Notes other than the proceeds used in accordance with clause (i) solely for the acquisition of aircraft and (iii) in each case of clauses (i) and (ii) in compliance with all applicable laws. The Outstanding Amount of each Convertible Note shall be automatically due and payable in full on the date that is the earlier of (1) three (3) business days following the termination of the Business Combination Agreement and (2) 363 days from the date of issuance of each respective Convertible Note (as applicable, the \u201cMaturity Date\u201d). If PubCo fails to pay any amount due pursuant to each Convertible Note within five business days of each respective Maturity Date, interest shall accrue at the rate of 17% per annum on the Outstanding Amount until the entire Outstanding Amount is paid in full. Investor Subscription Agreement Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company entered into a subscription agreement (the \u201cInvestor Subscription Agreement\u201d) with Investor. Pursuant to the Investor Subscription Agreement, Investor agreed to subscribe for and purchase, and the Company agreed to issue and sell to Investor, immediately prior to the Closing, an aggregate of 700,000 DSAQ Preferred Shares for a purchase price of $ 10.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $ 7,000,000 . The closing of the Investor Subscription Agreement will be conditioned on (i) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Hunch Subscription Agreement and (ii) the consummation of additional investments in an aggregate investment amount of $ 12,000,000 (\u201cMinimum Additional Investment\u201d), for DSAQ Preferred Shares, DSAQ Class A Shares, PubCo Preferred Shares or PubCo Ordinary Shares, issued to investors (the \u201cAdditional Investors\u201d), on terms and conditions that are not materially more advantageous to any such Additional Investors than Investor hereunder, unless such terms and conditions are consented to by Investor.

The Investor Subscription Agreement also provides that the Company will grant Investor certain customary registration rights. Hunch Subscription Agreement Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Business Combination Agreement, Quick Response Services Provider LLP (\u201cQRSP\u201d) entered into a subscription agreement (the \u201cHunch Subscription Agreement\u201d) with PubCo. Pursuant to the Hunch Subscription Agreement, QRSP agreed to subscribe for and purchase, and PubCo agreed to issue and sell to QRSP, immediately prior to the Closing, an aggregate of 300,000 PubCo Preferred Shares for a purchase price of $ 10.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $ 3,000,000 . The closing of the Hunch Subscription Agreement will be conditioned on the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Investor Subscription Agreement. The Hunch Subscription Agreement also contains customary conditions to closing, including, among other things, the consummation of the Business Combination. The Hunch Subscription Agreement also provides that PubCo will grant QRSP certain customary registration rights. Principal Shareholder Support Agreement Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company, Quick Response Services Provider LLP, a limited liability partnership incorporated under the laws of India (\u201cHunch\u201d), and Blade Urban Air Mobility Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with Hunch, the \u201cPrincipal Shareholders\u201d and each, a \u201cPrincipal Shareholder\u201d), and PubCo have entered into that Principal Shareholder Support Agreement (the \u201cPrincipal Shareholder Support Agreement\u201d) pursuant to which each Principal Shareholder has agreed, among other things: (i) to support and vote or consent to the requisite transaction proposals and (ii) not to transfer any equity security of PubCo until the earlier to occur of (a) the Closing, (b) such date and time as the Business Combination Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its terms and (c) the mutual agreement of the parties thereto, in each case subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. Sponsor Support Agreement Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Business Combination Agreement, the Sponsor, the Company, PubCo and, for certain limited purposes, certain of the Company\u2019s directors, executive officers and affiliates (such individuals, the \u201cInsiders\u201d) have entered into a Sponsor Support Agreement (the \u201cSponsor Support Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Sponsor Support Agreement, the Sponsor has, among other things, agreed to (i) support and vote in favor of the requisite transaction proposals; (ii) waive all adjustments to the conversion ratio set forth in Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation with respect to its DSAQ Class B Shares, (iii) be bound by certain transfer restrictions with respect to their DSAQ Class B Shares and the warrants of the Company, as applicable, prior to Closing and (iv) the forfeiture, transfer or conversion into DSAQ Class A Shares, as applicable of warrants of the Company under the terms and conditions set forth therein. Specifically, the Sponsor has agreed to make available up to 9,950,000 private placement warrants of the Company (or, if the DSAQ Warrant Amendment is approved, the PubCo Class A Ordinary Shares corresponding thereto) to existing stockholders of the Company in exchange for such stockholders agreeing not to redeem their DSAQ Class A Shares in connection with the Company\u2019s stockholder meeting. If less than all such private placement warrants (or, if the DSAQ Warrant Amendment is approved, the PubCo Class A Ordinary Shares corresponding 87 thereto) are so transferred, then the Sponsor shall (i) retain 50% of such private placement warrants not so transferred and (ii) forfeit 50% of such private placement warrants not so transferred. If the DSAQ Warrant Amendment is not approved, any such retained private placement warrants may, at the Sponsor\u2019s election, be surrendered to the Company prior to the Closing in exchange for one (1) DSAQ Class A Share for every five (5) private placement warrants so surrendered. If the DSAQ Warrant Amendment is approved, each such private placement warrant retained will automatically convert into one-fifth (1/5) of one DSAQ Class A Share (with no fractional shares being issued if less than five (5) warrants are held). Contingent Value Rights Agreement Concurrently with the consummation of the Business Combination Agreement, PubCo will enter into a Contingent Value Rights Agreement (the \u201cCVR Agreement\u201d) with a rights agent (\u201cRights Agent\u201d) pursuant to which the holders of DSAQ Class A Shares and DSAQ Class B Shares outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will receive one (1) CVR I, one (1) CVR II and one (1) CVR III (each, a \u201cCVR\u201d) for each one whole DSAQ Share held by such stockholder on such date. Each CVR I represents the right of the holder thereof to receive its pro rata share of 2,000,000 newly issued PubCo Class A Ordinary Shares, and each CVR I shall be exercised automatically upon PubCo\u2019s delivery of the CVR Payment Notice (as defined in the CVR Agreement) to the Rights Agent, notifying the Rights Agent that, during the 12 month period ending on the final day of the month in which the second anniversary of the Closing occurs, the consolidated revenues of PubCo and its subsidiaries was less than $ 50 million. Each CVR II represents the right of the holder thereof to receive its pro rata share of 2,000,000 newly issued PubCo Class A Ordinary Shares, and each CVR II shall be exercised automatically upon PubCo\u2019s delivery of the CVR Payment Notice to the Rights Agent, notifying the Rights Agent that, during the 12 month period ending on the final day of the month in which the third anniversary of the Closing occurs, the consolidated revenues of PubCo and its subsidiaries was less than $ 142 million. Each CVR III represents the right of the holder thereof to receive its pro rata share of 2,000,000 newly issued PubCo Class A Ordinary Shares, and each CVR III shall be exercised automatically upon PubCo\u2019s delivery of the CVR Payment Notice, notifying the Rights Agent that, during the 12 month period ending on the final day of the month in which the fourth anniversary of the Closing occurs, the consolidated revenues of PubCo and its subsidiaries was less than $ 263 million. The contingent payments under the CVR Agreement, if they become payable, will become payable to the Rights Agent for subsequent distribution to the holders of the CVRs. There can be no assurance that any payment of any PubCo Ordinary Shares will be made or that any holders of CVRs will receive any amounts with respect thereto. The right to the contingent payments contemplated by the CVR Agreement is a contractual right only. The CVRs will not be evidenced by a certificate or other instrument. The CVRs will not be transferable. The CVRs will not have any voting or dividend rights and will not represent any equity or ownership interest in PubCo or any of its affiliates. No interest will accrue on any amounts payable in respect of the CVRs. 88",

Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company\u2019s financial statements with another public company that is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. Risks and Uncertainties Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the \u201cIR Act\u201d) was signed into law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal 1 % excise tax on certain repurchases (including redemptions and economically similar transactions) of stock by publicly traded U.S. corporations on or after January 1, 2023. Because we are a Delaware corporation and our securities are trading on the New York Stock Exchange, we are a \u201ccovered corporation\u201d within the meaning of the IR Act. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its stockholders from which shares are repurchased (although it may reduce the amount of cash distributable in a current or subsequent redemption). The amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased, determined at the time of the repurchase. Corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances by such corporation against the fair market value of stock repurchases (or deemed repurchases) during the same taxable year to reduce or eliminate the amount of excise tax that would otherwise apply. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the \u201cTreasury\u201d) has authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out, and prevent the abuse or avoidance of, the excise tax. Whether and to what extent we would be subject to the excise tax will depend on a number of factors, including (i) whether the redemption is treated as a repurchase of stock for purposes of the excise tax, (ii) the fair market value of the redemptions treated as repurchases in connection with a Business Combination, (iii) the structure of a Business Combination and whether any such transaction closes, (iv) the nature and amount of any private investment in public equity (\u201cPIPE\u201d) or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of a Business Combination), (v) whether we consummate a Business Combination, and (vi) the content of regulations and other guidance issued by the Treasury. It is possible that the Company will be subject to the excise tax with respect to any subsequent redemptions, including redemptions in connection with a Business Combination, that are treated as repurchases for this purpose (other than, pursuant to recently issued guidance from the Treasury, redemptions in complete liquidation of the Company). As mentioned, the excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not the stockholders from which stock is repurchased. The 89 imposition of the excise tax (including as a result of holders of public shares electing to exercise their redemption rights in connection with a Business Combination) could, however, reduce the amount of cash available to the Company to pay redemptions (or the cash contribution to the target business in connection with a Business Combination, which could hinder the Company\u2019s ability to complete a Business Combination or cause the other shareholders of the combined company to economically bear the impact of such excise tax). For the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company has recognized $ 1,829,791 and $ 0 , respectively, in excise tax payable related to share redemptions. In accordance with ASC340-10-S99-1, the liability does not impact the statements of operations and is offset against accumulated deficit because additional paid-in capital is not available. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $ 467,309 in its operating bank account and a working capital deficit of $ 10,679,799 . 90",

            "context": "The Company has entered into promissory notes and working capital loans with the Sponsor for a total of $ 6,155,985 . These Notes bear no interest and are due upon liquidation or consummation of an initial Business Combination. If the Company completes an initial Business Combination, the Company would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that the initial Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from the Trust Account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $ 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $ 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. As of the date of this filing, the Company has until April 28, 2024, unless otherwise extended pursuant to the Charter and with a monthly additional deposit of $ 160,000 to the Trust Account, to consummate an initial Business Combination. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate an initial Business Combination within 12 months from the issuance date of these financial statements or obtain additional funding. If an initial Business Combination is not consummated by the required date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. In the event of a dissolution, we anticipate a shortfall of liquidity. Our anticipated shortfall of sufficient liquidity to meet our current and future estimated financial obligations raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within one year after the date that the accompanying financial statements are issued. We plan to address this uncertainty through working capital loans and through consummation of our initial Business Combination. There is no assurance that working capital loans will be available to us or that our plans to consummate an initial Business Combination will be successful. Note 2 \u2014 Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying financial statements are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cUS GAAP\u201d) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d). Use of Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statement, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company had $ 467,309 and $ 1,151,319 in cash and did not have any cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022. Cash and Investments Held in Trust Account At December 31, 2023, the Trust Account included a demand deposit account and at December 31, 2022 investments were substantially held in a money market fund characterized as Level 1 investments within the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 (as defined below). 91 Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of a cash accounts in financial institution, which, at times, may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage limit of $ 250,000 . At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company has not experienced losses on this account and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such account. 92",

Within the direct selling industry, as with many others, the <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">COVID-19</span> pandemic accelerated the adaption to, and implementation of, a wide variety of technologies. As a historically <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\"><span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">face-to-face</span></span> business, many direct selling companies have otherwise been slow to adapt to some of the new technologies; however, the transition has proved to be remarkably effective. We believe the direct selling industry is evolving from a \u201cwork from home\u201d model to a \u201cwork from phone\u201d model, allowing industry sales forces to work and run their businesses from anywhere, anytime. As such, we believe that seamless mobile applications and features such as mobile sampling platforms are critical to the future success of industry participants. Our team has extensive experience in these areas and the ability to assist and guide target companies in each of the relevant aspects, including branding, social marketing and selling, as well as mobile applications that provide a seamless distributor and customer experience. </p></td></tr></table><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"BORDER-COLLAPSE:COLLAPSE; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:10pt;border:0;width:100%\"> <tr style=\"page-break-inside:avoid\"> <td style=\"width:5%\">\u00a0</td> <td align=\"left\" style=\"width:3%;vertical-align:top\">\u2022</td> <td style=\"width:1%;vertical-align:top\">\u00a0</td> <td align=\"left\" style=\"vertical-align:top\"> <p style=\" margin-top:0pt ; margin-bottom:0pt; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:10pt;text-align:left\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Product Line Expansion: </span></span>The independent sales forces and customer bases of direct selling companies represent a captive, engaged audience numbering, in the case of the majority of our target universe, in the hundreds of thousands, if not millions.
