An \u201coverriding\u201d royalty interest in general represents a non-operating interest in an oil and gas property that provides the owner a specified share of production without any related operating expenses or development costs and is carved out of an oil and gas lessee\u2019s working or cost-bearing interest in the lease. In contrast, a \u201cworking\u201d or \u201ccost-bearing\u201d interest in general represents an operating interest in an oil and gas property that provides the owner a specified share of production that is subject to all production expenses and development costs. An owner of a working or cost-bearing interest, subject to the terms of an applicable operating agreement, generally has the right to participate in the selection of a prospect, drilling location or drilling contractor; to propose the drilling of a well; to determine the timing and sequence of drilling operations; to commence or shut down production; to take over operations; or to share in any operating decision. An owner of an overriding royalty interest generally has none of the rights described in the preceding sentence, and neither the Royalty Trust nor the Royalty Trust unitholders has any such rights.",

In 2012 and 2016, the EPA adopted federal New Source Performance Standards (\u201cNSPS\u201d) that require the reduction of volatile organic compound and sulfur dioxide emissions from certain fractured and refractured natural gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted and further require that most wells use reduced emission completions, also known as \u201cgreen completions.\u201d These regulations also establish specific requirements regarding emissions from production-related wet seal and reciprocating compressors, pumps, and from pneumatic controllers and storage vessels, and for equipment leaks. These NSPS apply to sources that are newly constructed or modified after the rules\u2019 applicability dates. More recently, in December 2023 the EPA adopted a final rule that will directly regulate volatile organic compound and methane emissions from oil and gas sources constructed or modified after December 2022 and will require reductions in both pollutants through its regulation of flaring, compressors, pumps, storage vessels, process controllers, well completions and liquids unloading, and equipment leaks. Additionally, the EPA for the first time adopted emissions guidelines that will apply to existing oil and gas sources and that require reductions in volatile organic compound and methane emissions that are largely equivalent to the requirements for new sources. The existing source emissions guidelines are to be implemented through state plans, with expected compliance dates for existing sources arriving in 2029.",

This process routinely results in the tightening of those standards, and in October 2015, the EPA lowered the ozone NAAQS from 75 to 70 parts per billion. In December 2020, the EPA published a final rule that retained without revision the 2015 NAAQS ozone standard. More recently, however, in February 2024, the EPA has announced a final rule that will lower the annual standard for fine particulate matter from 12 micrograms per cubic meter to 9 micrograms per cubic meter.

HOGA informed the Trustee that the well was shut in effective March 31, 2023 and production from the well has ceased. Since that time the well has flowed intermittently but not on a continuous basis. In October 2023, HOGA informed the Trustee that due to the underground flow of fluids into the wellbore, the well cannot be salvaged and must be plugged and abandoned.

OVERRIDING ROYALTY INTERESTS The Royalty Trust units represent beneficial interests in the Royalty Trust, which holds a 5% gross overriding royalty interest in future production from each of the subject interests during the life of the Royalty Trust. An \u201coverriding\u201d royalty interest in general represents a non-operating interest in an oil and gas property that provides the owner a specified share of production without any related operating expenses or development costs and is carved out of an oil and gas lessee\u2019s working or cost-bearing interest in the lease. In contrast, a \u201cworking\u201d or \u201ccost-bearing\u201d interest in general represents an operating interest in an oil and gas property that provides the owner a specified share of production that is subject to all production expenses and development costs. An owner of a working or cost-bearing interest, subject to the terms of an applicable operating agreement, generally has the right to participate in the selection of a prospect, drilling location or drilling contractor; to propose the drilling of a well; to determine the timing and sequence of drilling operations; to commence or shut down production; to take over operations; or to share in any operating decision. An owner of an overriding royalty interest generally has none of the rights described in the preceding sentence, and neither the Royalty Trust nor the Royalty Trust unitholders have any such rights.

No ruling has been or will be requested from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or another taxing authority. As a grantor trust, the Royalty Trust will not be subject to tax at the Royalty Trust level.

Those Treasury Regulations require the sharing of tax information among trustees and intermediaries that hold a trust interest on behalf of or for the account of a beneficial owner or any representative or agent of a trust interest holder of fixed investment trusts that are classified as widely held fixed investment trusts. These reporting requirements provide for the dissemination of trust tax information by the trustee to intermediaries who are ultimately responsible for reporting the investor-specific information through Form 1099 to the investors and the IRS. Every trustee or intermediary that is required to file a Form 1099 for a trust unitholder must furnish a written tax information statement that is in support of the amounts as reported on the applicable Form 1099 to the trust unitholder.

However, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production, including many factors beyond the Royalty Trust\u2019s control. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating the recovery from underground accumulations of natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner, and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Because all natural gas reserve estimates are to some degree subjective, the quantities of natural gas that are ultimately recovered, production and specified post-production costs and taxes allowable under the Royalty Trust Agreement and future natural gas sales prices may all differ from those assumed in these estimates. In addition, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities and cash flows based upon the same available data.
