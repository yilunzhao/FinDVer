BUSINESS.\nIntroduction We are a blank check company whose business purpose is to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to as our \u201cBusiness Combination.\u201d We have not selected any potential Business Combination target. While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any industry or sector, we are focused on identifying a Business Combination target within the professional service industry that provides accounting, legal, financial, advisory or other services to public companies or private companies that are in the process of becoming public companies with enterprise valuations in the range of $500 million to $2 billion. We intend to specifically focus on companies that have strong, consistent revenue growth and cash flow. We have reviewed, and continue to review, a number of opportunities to enter into a Business Combination, but we are not able to determine at this time whether we will complete a Business Combination with any of the target businesses that we have reviewed or with any other target business. We also have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a \u201cshell company\u201d as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.",

On September 8, 2022, our Sponsor surrendered to us 718,750 Founder Shares for no consideration, resulting in our Sponsor owning 2,156,250 Founder Shares and increasing the approximate price paid per Founder Share to $0.012. On September 29, 2022, our Sponsor surrendered to us an additional 431,250 Founder Shares for no consideration, resulting in our Sponsor owning 1,725,000 Founder Shares and increasing the approximate price paid per Founder Share to $0.015. Mr. You, the manager of our Sponsor, has voting and investment discretion with respect to the common stock held by the Sponsor. Our Sponsor intends to transfer 25,000 Founder Shares to each of Darla Anderson, Francesca Luthi, Charles Wert and Constance Weaver, our independent directors, upon the completion of our initial Business Combination, resulting in our Sponsor holding at that time 1,479,750 Founder Shares (taking into account the 145,250 shares forfeited upon the underwriter\u2019s exercise of its over- allotment option). Prior to the initial investment in the company of $25,000 by the Sponsor, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible. The per share price of the Founder Shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash contributed to the company by the number of Founder Shares issued. In addition, on October 11, 2022, further to the underwriter\u2019s partial exercise of the over-allotment option and forfeiture of the remaining amount, our Sponsor forfeited 145,250 Founder Shares, resulting in an aggregate of 1,579,750 Class B Shares outstanding. A total of $64,137,850 of the net proceeds from the initial public offering (including the underwriter\u2019s Over-Allotment Units), the sale of the Private Placement Warrants with our Sponsor (including the Additional Private Placement Warrants) and the Overfunding Loans from our Sponsor (including the Additional Overfunding Loan) was placed in a U.S.-based trust account (the \u201cTrust Account\u201d) at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. The funds held in the Trust Account may be (i) held uninvested, (ii) held in an interest-bearing bank demand deposit account, or (iii) invested and reinvested in solely U.S. \u201cgovernment securities\u201d within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d) having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination, (ii) the redemption of Public Shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our Amended and Restated Articles of Organization to modify the substance or timing of our of our obligation to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete our initial Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below) or with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders\u2019 rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity, and (iii) our return of the funds held in the Trust Account to our Public Shareholders as part of our redemption of the Public Shares if we do not complete an initial Business Combination during the Combination Period. The trustee is not permitted to invest in other securities or assets. Investing in our securities is not intended for persons who are seeking a return on investments in government securities or investment securities. Instead, the Trust Account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the use of such funds upon completion of a Business Combination or distribution upon redemption of our Public Shares. As of December 31, 2023, there was $67,545,266 in investments held in the Trust Account. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had withdrawn $304,000 from the interest earned from the Trust Account to pay taxes. The Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Articles of Organization (the \u201cCharter\u201d) initially provided 15 months from the closing of the initial public offering, or January 4, 2024 (the \u201cPrior Outside Date\u201d), to consummate an initial Business Combination. The Charter also permitted the Company, by resolution of the board of directors, to extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination twice by an additional 3 month period (for a total of 21 months to complete a Business Combination), subject to the Sponsor depositing into the Trust Account $631,900 in the aggregate for each extension (the \u201cPrior Contributions\u201d). The Sponsor did not intend to deposit such Prior Contributions into the Trust Account. Accordingly, following January 4, 2024, the Company would have been forced to liquidate. The Company\u2019s board of directors determined that, in order for the Company to have additional time to complete a Business Combination in a more cost effective manner, it would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to extend the Prior Outside Date to allow for a period of additional time to consummate the Business Combination. On January 2, 2024, the Company held a special meeting of its shareholders (the \u201cSpecial Meeting\u201d). At the Special Meeting, the Company\u2019s shareholders approved an amendment of the Charter to extend (the \u201cExtension\u201d) the date by which the Company has to consummate a Business Combination up to twenty-three (23) times for an additional one (1) month each time (each, an \u201cExtension Period\u201d) from January 4, 2024 to January 29, 2024 (the \u201cExtended Date\u201d) and to allow the Company, without another shareholder vote, by resolution of the board of directors, to elect to further extend the Extended Date up to twenty-three times for an additional one month each time, until up to December 29, 2025 (each, an \u201cAdditional Extended Date\u201d, and such period in its entirety, from the initial public offering until the final Additional Extended Date, the \u201cCombination Period\u201d), only if the Sponsor or its designee would deposit (the \u201cContribution\u201d) into the Trust Account as a loan, (i) on or before January 4, 2024, with respect to the initial extension, an amount of $41,667, and (ii) one business day following the public announcement by us disclosing that the board of directors has determined to implement an additional monthly extension, with respect to each such additional extension, an amount of $50,000. In connection with the shareholder approval of the Extension, an aggregate of 3,980,414 Public Shares were redeemed, and the Company paid approximately $42.0 million accordingly on January 4, 2024. 7",

In connection with the Contribution and advances our Sponsor may make in the future to us for working capital expenses, on January 2, 2024, we issued a convertible promissory note to Harry L. You, our Chairman and Chief Financial Officer and an affiliate of our Sponsor (the \u201cPayee\u201d), with a principal amount up to $1.75 million (the \u201cConvertible Note\u201d). The Convertible Note bears no interest and is repayable on the earlier of: (i) the date on which we consummate an initial Business Combination and (ii) the liquidation date. If we do not consummate a Business Combination before the end of the Combination Period, the Convertible Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. Upon the consummation of our initial Business Combination, the outstanding principal of the Convertible Note may be converted into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant, at the option of the Payee. Since January 2, 2024, our board of directors has elected to extend our liquidation date to April 29, 2024. Accordingly, we have drawn down from the Convertible Note and deposited $191,667 into the Trust Account in connection with such extension. Effecting Our Initial Business Combination General We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial Business Combination using investments held in the Trust Account, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial Business Combination (including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We intend to specifically focus on companies that have strong, consistent revenue growth and cash flow. If our initial Business Combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial Business Combination or used for redemptions of the Public Shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial Business Combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 8",

            "context": "Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any industry or sector, we intend to focus on companies within the professional service industry that provide accounting, legal, financial, advisory or other services to public companies or private companies that are in the process of becoming public companies with enterprise valuations in the range of $500 million to $2 billion. We intend to specifically focus on companies that have strong, consistent revenue growth and cash flow. NYSE American rules require that we must consummate an initial Business Combination with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting commissions). Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial Business Combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial Business Combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d) or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial Business Combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target\u2019s assets or prospects. We anticipate structuring our initial Business Combination so that the post-transaction company in which holders of our Public Shares (the \u201cPublic Shareholders\u201d) own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial Business Combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the Business Combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial Business Combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% of net assets test described above. If the Business Combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspections of facilities, as well as reviewing financial and other information which will be made available to us. The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial Business Combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial Business Combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another Business Combination. We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial Business Combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, executive officers or directors, or completing the Business Combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our Sponsor, executive officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete an initial Business Combination with a target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm stating that such an initial Business Combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. 9",

The amount in the Trust Account as of December 31, 2023 is approximately $10.53 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to Public Shareholders who properly redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions that we will pay to the underwriter. Our Sponsor and the Company\u2019s officers have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and any Public Shares they may hold in connection with the completion of the initial Business Combination. The Founder Shares will be excluded from the pro rata calculation used to determine the per-share redemption price. Conduct of Redemptions Pursuant to Tender Offer Rules If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d), we will, pursuant to our Charter: (a) conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and (b) file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial Business Combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial Business Combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. Submission of Our Initial Business Combination to a Shareholder Vote In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial Business Combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our Public Shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the Business Combination. If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial Business Combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the initial Business Combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the Company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial shareholders will count towards this quorum and, pursuant to the letter agreement, our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote any Founder Shares they hold, and any Public Shares purchased during or after our initial public offering (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial Business Combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial Business Combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders\u2019 Founder Shares, we would need only 379,419, or 16.2%, of the 2,338,586 outstanding Public Shares to be voted in favor of an initial Business Combination in order to have our initial Business Combination approved (assuming all outstanding shares are voted). These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial shareholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial Business Combination. Each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem its Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the such Business Combination or whether they were a shareholder on the record date for the shareholder meeting held to approve the Business Combination. 10",

There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants if we fail to complete our initial Business Combination before the end of the Combination Period. Competition In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial Business Combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other special purpose acquisition companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting Business Combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our Public Shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial Business Combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial Business Combination. Employees We currently have two executive officers: Niccolo de Masi and Harry You. Mr. de Masi and Mr. You are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial Business Combination.

            "context": "14 The ability of our Public Shareholders to redeem their Public Shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential Business Combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into a Business Combination with a target. We may seek to enter into a Business Combination transaction agreement with minimum cash requirement for (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions. If too many Public Shareholders exercise their redemption rights, we would not be able to meet such closing condition and, as a result, would not be able to proceed with the Business Combination. Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would make us unable to satisfy a minimum cash condition as described above, we would not proceed with such redemption and the related Business Combination and may instead search for an alternate Business Combination. Prospective targets will be aware of these risks and, thus, may be reluctant to enter into a Business Combination transaction with us. The ability of our Public Shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our Public Shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable Business Combination or optimize our capital structure. At the time we enter into an agreement for our initial Business Combination, we will not know how many shareholders may exercise their redemption rights, and therefore will need to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of Public Shares that will be submitted for redemption. If our initial Business Combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the Trust Account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the Trust Account to meet such requirements, or arrange for third-party financing. In addition, if a larger number of Public Shares is submitted for redemption than we initially expected, we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the Trust Account or arrange for third-party financing. Raising additional third-party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. Furthermore, this dilution would increase to the extent that the anti-dilution provision of the Class B Shares results in the issues of Class A Shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the Class B Shares at the time of our initial Business Combination. In addition, the amount of the deferred underwriting commissions payable to the underwriter will not be adjusted for any Public Shares that are redeemed in connection with an initial Business Combination. The per share amount we will distribute to Public Shareholders who properly exercise their redemption rights will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commission and after such redemptions, the amount held in trust will continue to reflect our obligation to pay the entire deferred underwriting commissions. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete the most desirable Business Combination available to us or optimize our capital structure. The ability of our Public Shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our Public Shares could increase the probability that our initial Business Combination would be unsuccessful and that you would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem your Public Shares. If our initial Business Combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the Trust Account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, the probability that our initial Business Combination would be unsuccessful is increased. If our initial Business Combination is unsuccessful, you would not receive your pro rata portion of the Trust Account until we liquidate the Trust Account. If you are in need of immediate liquidity, you could attempt to sell your shares in the open market; however, at such time our shares may trade at a discount to the pro rata amount per share in the Trust Account. In either situation, you may suffer a material loss on your investment or lose the benefit of funds expected in connection with your exercise of redemption rights until we liquidate or you are able to sell your shares in the open market. 15",

Any potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning a Business Combination will be aware that we must complete our initial Business Combination within the Combination Period. Consequently, such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating a Business Combination, knowing that if we do not complete our initial Business Combination with that particular target business, we may be unable to complete our initial Business Combination with any target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the end of the Combination Period. In addition, we may have limited time to conduct due diligence and may enter into our initial Business Combination on terms that we would have rejected upon a more comprehensive investigation. Our search for a Business Combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a Business Combination, may be materially adversely affected by events that are outside of our control, such as increased geopolitical unrest, pandemic outbreaks (such as COVID-19), and volatility in the debt and equity markets. Our ability to find a potential target business and the business of any potential target business with which we may consummate a Business Combination could be materially and adversely affected by events that are outside of our control. For example, geopolitical unrest, including war, terrorist activity and acts of civil or international hostility are increasing. Similarly, other events outside of our control, including natural disasters, climate-related events, pandemics or health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) may arise from time to time. Any such events may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets, disproportionate impacts to certain industries or sectors, disruptions to commerce (including to economic activity, travel and supply chains), loss of life and property damage, and may adversely affect the global economy or capital markets, and the business of any potential target business with which we may consummate a Business Combination could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by these and other events, including as a result of increased market volatility, decreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all. Recent increases in inflation in the United States and elsewhere could make it more difficult for us to consummate a Business Combination. Recent increases in inflation in the United States and elsewhere may be leading to increased price volatility for publicly traded securities, including ours, and may lead to other national, regional and international economic disruptions, any of which could make it more difficult for us to consummate a Business Combination. We may not be able to complete our initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our Public Shares and liquidate. We may not be able to find a suitable target business and complete our initial Business Combination within the Combination Period. Our ability to complete our initial Business Combination may be negatively impacted by general market conditions, volatility in the capital and debt markets and the other risks described herein. If we have not completed our initial Business Combination within such time period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem one hundred percent (100%) of the Offering Shares in consideration of a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest not previously released to the Corporation to pay its taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), by (B) the total number of then outstanding Offering Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish rights of the Public Shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Board in accordance with applicable law, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Corporation\u2019s obligations under the MBCA to provide for claims of creditors and other requirements of applicable law. 16",

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase Public Shares or Public Warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial Business Combination, although they are under no obligation to do so.

However, other than as expressly stated herein, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the Trust Account will be used to purchase Public Shares or Public Warrants in such transactions. Such purchases may include a contractual acknowledgment that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase Public Shares in privately negotiated transactions from Public Shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. The purpose of any such purchases of Public Shares could be to increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the Business Combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial Business Combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of Public Warrants could be to reduce the number of Public Warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial Business Combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial Business Combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public \u201cfloat\u201d of our Class A Shares or Public Warrants and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, possibly making it difficult to obtain or maintain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.

Our Sponsor may decide not to extend the term we have to consummate our initial Business Combination, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our Public Shares and liquidate. We initially had 15 months from the closing of the initial public offering, or January 4, 2024, to consummate an initial Business Combination. The Company\u2019s Charter also provided that the Company could, by resolution of the board of directors, extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination twice by an additional 3 month period (for a total of 21 months to complete a Business Combination), subject to the Sponsor depositing into the Trust Account $631,900 in the aggregate for each extension. The Sponsor did not intend to deposit such Prior Contributions into the Trust Account. Accordingly, following January 4, 2024, the Company would have been forced to liquidate. The Company\u2019s board of directors determined that, in order for the Company to have additional time to complete a Business Combination in a more cost effective manner, it would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to extend the Prior Outside Date to allow for a period of additional time to consummate the business combination.\u2003On January 2, 2024, the Company held a Special Meeting. At the Special Meeting, the Company\u2019s shareholders approved an amendment of the Company\u2019s Charter to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a Business Combination up to twenty-three (23) times for an additional one (1) month each time from January 4, 2024 to January 29, 2024 and to allow the Company, without another shareholder vote, by resolution of the board of directors, to elect to further extend the Extended Date up to twenty-three times for an additional one month each time, until up to December 29, 2025, only if the Sponsor or its designee would deposit into the Trust Account as a loan, (i) on or before January 4, 2024, with respect to the initial extension, an amount of $41,667, and (ii) one business day following the public announcement by us disclosing that the board of directors has determined to implement an additional monthly extension, with respect to each such Additional Extension, an amount of $50,000. In connection with the shareholder approval of the Extension, an aggregate of 3,980,414 Public Shares were redeemed, and the Company paid approximately $40.4 million accordingly on January 4, 2024. 17",

Such Contribution may be converted into warrants upon the consummation of our initial Business Combination, at a price of $1.00 per warrant, at the option of our Sponsor. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. If we complete our initial Business Combination, and our Sponsor decides not to convert the Contribution into warrants, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us after payment of all redeeming Public Shareholders. If we do not complete a Business Combination, the aggregate amount of the Contribution would be repaid paid at our liquidation only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. Any such Contributions would be in addition to the Overfunding Loans and any working capital loans made to us. Our Sponsor and its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the Trust Account to extend the time for us to complete our initial Business Combination.

In addition, proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our Public Shares in connection with our initial Business Combination will describe the various procedures that must be complied with in order to validly tender or submit Public Shares for redemption.

In the case of proxy materials, this date may be up to two business days prior to the date on which the vote on the proposal to approve the initial Business Combination is to be held. In addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote, we intend to require a Public Shareholder seeking redemption of its Public Shares to also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent two business days prior to the vote in which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included. In the event that a shareholder fails to comply with these or any other procedures disclosed in the proxy or tender offer materials, as applicable, its Public Shares may not be redeemed. You will not have any rights or interests in funds from the Trust Account, except under certain limited circumstances. Therefore, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your Public Shares or warrants, potentially at a loss. Our Public Shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial Business Combination, and then only in connection with those Public Shares that such shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described herein, (ii) the redemption of any Public Shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our Charter to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete our initial Business Combination within the Combination Period or with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders\u2019 rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of our Public Shares if we are unable to complete an initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, subject to applicable law and as further described herein. In addition, if our plan to redeem our Public Shares if we are unable to complete an initial Business Combination within the Combination Period is not completed for any reason, compliance with Massachusetts law may require that we submit a plan of dissolution to our then-existing shareholders for approval prior to the distribution of the proceeds held in our Trust Account. In that case, Public Shareholders may be forced to wait beyond the Combination Period before they receive funds from our Trust Account.

Since the net proceeds of our initial public offering, the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, the Overfunding Loans, and the Contributions are intended to be used to complete an initial Business Combination with a target business that has not been selected, we may be deemed to be a \u201cblank check\u201d company under the United States securities laws. However, we are exempt from rules promulgated by the SEC to protect investors in blank check companies, such as Rule 419. Accordingly, investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules. Among other things, this means we will have a longer period of time to complete our initial Business Combination than do companies subject to Rule 419. Moreover, if our initial public offering had been subject to Rule 419, that rule would prohibit the release of any interest earned on funds held in the Trust Account to us unless and until the funds in the Trust Account were released to us in connection with our completion of an initial Business Combination. Because of our limited resources and the significant competition for Business Combination opportunities, attractive targets may become scarcer and there may be more competition, making it more costly and more difficult for us to complete our initial Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination, our Public Shareholders may receive only their pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account that are available for distribution to Public Shareholders. We expect to encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess similar or greater technical, human and other resources to ours or more local industry knowledge than we do, and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering, the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, the Overfunding Loans and the Contributions, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, we are obligated to offer holders of our Public Shares the right to redeem their Public Shares for cash at the time of our initial Business Combination in conjunction with a shareholder vote or via a tender offer. Target companies will be aware that this may reduce the resources available to us for our initial Business Combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination, our Public Shareholders may receive only their pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account that are available for distribution to Public Shareholders. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants. In recent years, the number of special purpose acquisition companies that have been formed has increased substantially. Many potential targets for special purpose acquisition companies have already entered into an initial business combination, and there are still many special purpose acquisition companies seeking targets for their initial business combination, as well as many such companies currently in registration. As a result, at times, fewer attractive targets may be available, and it may require more time, more effort and more resources to identify a suitable target and to consummate an initial business combination. In addition, because there are more special purpose acquisition companies seeking to enter into an initial business combination with available targets, the competition for available targets with attractive fundamentals or business models may increase, which could cause target companies to demand improved financial terms. Attractive deals could also become scarcer for other reasons, such as economic or industry sector downturns, geopolitical tensions or increases in the cost of additional capital needed to close business combinations or operate targets post-business combination. This could increase the cost of, delay or otherwise complicate or frustrate our ability to find and consummate an initial Business Combination, and may result in our inability to consummate an initial Business Combination on terms favorable to our investors altogether. 20",

If we entered into a letter of intent or merger agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business and were subsequently required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise), we might not have sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conduct due diligence with respect to, a target business. In order to provide the Contribution and to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Company issued the Convertible Note to an affiliate of the Sponsor with a principal amount up to $1.75 million on January 2, 2024. If we are required to seek additional capital for consummating an initial Business Combination, we would need to borrow funds from our Sponsor, management team or other third parties to operate or may be forced to liquidate. Neither our Sponsor, members of our management team nor any of their affiliates is under any obligation to advance funds to us in such circumstances. Any such advances would be repaid only from funds held outside the Trust Account or from funds released to us upon completion of our initial Business Combination. Up to $1,500,000 of such working capital loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-Business Combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. Prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our Trust Account. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. Consequently, our Public Shareholders may only receive an estimated $10.15 per share, or possibly less, on our redemption of our Public Shares. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants. Subsequent to our completion of our initial Business Combination, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and the price of our securities, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment. Even if we conduct extensive due diligence on a target business with which we combine, we cannot assure you that this diligence will identify all material issues that may be present with a particular target business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining debt financing to partially finance the initial Business Combination or thereafter. Accordingly, any shareholders or warrant holders who choose to remain shareholders or warrant holders following the Business Combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such shareholders or warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, relating to the Business Combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission. 21",

Our placing of funds in the Trust Account may not protect those funds from third party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (except for our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our Public Shareholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if they execute such agreements they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our management will consider whether competitive alternatives are reasonably available to us and will only enter into an agreement with such third party if management believes that such third party\u2019s engagement would be in the best interests of the company under the circumstances. The underwriter of our initial public offering as well as our registered independent public accounting firm will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. Upon redemption of our Public Shares, if we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination within the prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial Business Combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by Public Shareholders could be less than the $10.15 per Public Share initially held in the Trust Account, due to claims of such creditors. Pursuant to the letter agreement the form of which was filed in connection with our initial public offering, our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or Business Combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.15 per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.15 per Public Share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our Sponsor\u2019s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the Trust Account, the funds available for our initial Business Combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.15 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial Business Combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your Public Shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 22",

In the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.15 per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than $10.15 per Public Share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case less taxes payable, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment and subject to their fiduciary duties may choose not to do so in any particular instance. If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the Trust Account available for distribution to our Public Shareholders may be reduced below $10.15 per share. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy indemnification claims of our directors and executive officers. We have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law. However, our officers and directors have agreed to waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account and to not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason whatsoever. Accordingly, any indemnification provided will be able to be satisfied by us only if (i) we have sufficient funds outside of the Trust Account or (ii) we consummate an initial Business Combination. Our obligation to indemnify our officers and directors may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against our officers or directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against our officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our shareholders. Furthermore, a shareholder\u2019s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against our officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions. If, after we distribute the proceeds in the Trust Account to our Public Shareholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our board of directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of our board of directors and us to claims of punitive damages. If, after we distribute the proceeds in the Trust Account to our Public Shareholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a \u201cpreferential transfer\u201d or a \u201cfraudulent conveyance.\u201d As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, by paying Public Shareholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages. If, before distributing the proceeds in the Trust Account to our Public Shareholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of our shareholders and the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our shareholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced. If, before distributing the proceeds in the Trust Account to our Public Shareholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our shareholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced. 23",

            "context": "Our shareholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their Public Shares. Under the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act (the \u201cMBCA\u201d), shareholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our Public Shareholders upon the redemption of our Public Shares in the event we do not complete our initial Business Combination before the end of the Combination Period may be considered a liquidating distribution under Massachusetts law. If a corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Sections 14.06, 14.07 and 14.08 of the MBCA intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, any liability of shareholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such shareholder\u2019s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the shareholder within three years of dissolution, and any liability of the shareholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. However, it is our intention to redeem our Public Shares as soon as reasonably possible following the 15th month from the closing of our initial public offering in the event we do not complete our initial Business Combination and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with the foregoing procedures. We plan to make adequate provision, by payment or otherwise, for all of the corporation\u2019s then existing and reasonably foreseeable debts, liabilities and obligations, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us following our dissolution. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our shareholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our shareholders may extend beyond the third anniversary of such date. We have not and may not hold an annual meeting of shareholders until after the consummation of our initial Business Combination, which could delay the opportunity for our shareholders to elect directors. In accordance with the NYSE American\u2019s corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual meeting until no later than one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on the NYSE American. Under Section 7.01 of the MBCA, we are, however, required to hold an annual meeting of shareholders for the purposes of electing directors in accordance with our amended and restated bylaws unless such election is made by written consent in lieu of such a meeting. We have not and may not hold an annual meeting of shareholders to elect new directors prior to the consummation of our initial Business Combination, and thus we may not be in compliance with Section 7.01 of the MBCA, which requires an annual meeting. Therefore, if our shareholders want us to hold an annual meeting prior to the consummation of our initial Business Combination, they may attempt to force us to hold one by submitting an application to the Superior Court of Suffolk County in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in accordance with Section 7.03 of the MBCA. Because we are neither limited to evaluating a target business in a particular industry sector nor have we selected any specific target businesses with which to pursue our initial Business Combination, you will be unable to ascertain the merits or risks of any particular target business\u2019s operations. Our efforts to identify a prospective initial Business Combination target will not be limited to a particular industry, sector or geographic region. While we may pursue an initial Business Combination opportunity in any industry or sector, we intend to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify, acquire and operate a business or businesses that can benefit from our management team\u2019s established global relationships and operating experience. Our management team has extensive experience in identifying and executing strategic investments globally and has done so successfully in a number of sectors. Our Charter prohibits us from effectuating a Business Combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations. Because we have not yet selected any specific target business with respect to a Business Combination, there is no basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any particular target business\u2019s operations, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition or prospects. To the extent we complete our initial Business Combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations with which we combine. For example, if we combine with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings, we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or a development stage entity. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors or that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our securities will ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if such opportunity were available, in a Business Combination target. Accordingly, any shareholders or warrant holders who choose to remain shareholders or warrant holders following the Business Combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such shareholders or warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, relating to the Business Combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission. 24",

We will consider a Business Combination outside of our management\u2019s areas of expertise if a Business Combination candidate is presented to us and we determine that such candidate offers an attractive Business Combination opportunity for our company. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular Business Combination candidate, we cannot assure you that we will adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our securities will not ultimately prove to be less favorable to investors in our initial public offering than a direct investment, if an opportunity were available, in a Business Combination candidate. In the event we elect to pursue a Business Combination outside of the areas of our management\u2019s expertise, our management\u2019s expertise may not be directly applicable to its evaluation or operation, and the information contained in the prospectus dated September 29, 2022 filed in connection with our initial public offering regarding the areas of our management\u2019s expertise would not be relevant to an understanding of the business that we elect to acquire. As a result, our management may not be able to ascertain or assess adequately all of the relevant risk factors. Accordingly, any shareholders who choose to remain shareholders following our initial Business Combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares. Such shareholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value. Although we have identified general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses, we may enter into our initial Business Combination with a target that does not meet such criteria and guidelines, and as a result, the target business with which we enter into our initial Business Combination may not have attributes entirely consistent with our general criteria and guidelines. Although we have identified general criteria and guidelines for evaluating prospective target businesses, it is possible that a target business with which we enter into our initial Business Combination will not have all of these positive attributes. If we complete our initial Business Combination with a target that does not meet some or all of these guidelines, such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a business that does meet all of our general criteria and guidelines. In addition, if we announce a prospective Business Combination with a target that does not meet our general criteria and guidelines, a greater number of shareholders may exercise their redemption rights, which may make it difficult for us to meet any closing condition with a target business that requires us to have a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial Business Combination. In addition, if shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons, it may be more difficult for us to attain shareholder approval of our initial Business Combination if the target business does not meet our general criteria and guidelines.

Unless we complete our initial Business Combination with an affiliated entity or our board of directors cannot independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses (including with the assistance of financial advisors), we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or from a valuation or appraisal firm that the price we are paying is fair to our shareholders from a financial point of view. If no opinion is obtained, our shareholders will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors, who will determine fair market value based on standards generally accepted by the financial community. Such standards used will be disclosed in our proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, related to our initial Business Combination. Additionally, pursuant to the NYSE American rules, any initial Business Combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors. Resources could be wasted in researching Business Combinations that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination, our Public Shareholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account that are available for distribution to Public Shareholders. We anticipate that the investigation of each specific target business and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If we decide not to complete a specific initial Business Combination, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, if we reach an agreement relating to a specific target business, we may fail to complete our initial Business Combination for any number of reasons including those beyond our control.

When evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial Business Combination with a prospective target business, our ability to assess the target business\u2019s management may be limited due to a lack of time, resources or information. Our assessment of the capabilities of the target business\u2019s management, therefore, may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities we suspected.

We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our Charter, other governing instruments, or certain agreements related to our initial public offering in a manner that will make it easier for us to complete our initial Business Combination that our shareholders may not support, and such amendments may be done without shareholder approval. In order to effectuate a Business Combination, special purpose acquisition companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and governing instruments, including their warrant agreements. For example, special purpose acquisition companies have amended the definition of business combination, increased redemption thresholds and extended the time to consummate an initial business combination and, with respect to their warrants, amended their warrant agreements to require the warrants to be exchanged for cash and/or other securities. Amending our Charter requires the approval of holders of 65% of our common stock, and amending our warrant agreement requires a vote of holders of at least 50% of the Public Warrants and, solely with respect to any amendment to the terms of the Private Placement Warrants or any provision of the warrant agreement with respect to the Private Placement Warrants, 50% of the number of the then outstanding Private Placement Warrants. In addition, our Charter requires us to provide our Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares for cash if we propose an amendment to our Charter to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete an initial business within the Combination Period, or with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders\u2019 rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity. To the extent any of such amendments would be deemed to fundamentally change the nature of the securities offered through the offering, we would register, or seek an exemption from registration for, the affected securities. We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our Charter or governing instruments or extend the time to consummate an initial Business Combination in order to effectuate our initial Business Combination. Each of the agreements related to our initial public offering to which we are a party, other than the warrant agreement and the Investment Management Trust Agreement, may be amended without shareholder approval. Such agreements are: the underwriting agreement; the letter agreement among us and our Sponsor, officers and directors; the registration rights agreement among us and our initial shareholders; the private placement warrants purchase agreement between us and our Sponsor; and the administrative services agreement among us, our Sponsor and an affiliate of our Sponsor. These agreements contain various provisions that our Public Shareholders might deem to be material. For example, our letter agreement and the underwriting agreement contain certain lock-up provisions with respect to the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and other securities held by our initial shareholders, Sponsor, officers and directors. Amendments to such agreements would require the consent of the applicable parties thereto and would need to be approved by our board of directors, which may do so for a variety of reasons, including to facilitate our initial Business Combination. While we do not expect our board of directors to approve any amendment to any of these agreements prior to our initial Business Combination, it may be possible that our board of directors, in exercising its business judgment and subject to its fiduciary duties, chooses to approve one or more amendments to any such agreement. Any amendment entered into in connection with the consummation of our initial Business Combination will be disclosed in our proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, related to such initial Business Combination, and any other material amendment to any of our material agreements will be disclosed in a filing with the SEC. Any such amendments would not require approval from our shareholders, may result in the completion of our initial Business Combination that may not otherwise have been possible, and may have an adverse effect on the value of an investment in our securities. For example, amendments to the lock-up provision discussed above may result in our initial shareholders selling their securities earlier than they would otherwise be permitted, which may have an adverse effect on the price of our securities. 31",

It may be easier for us, therefore, to amend our Charter to facilitate the completion of an initial Business Combination that some of our shareholders may not support. Our Charter provides that any of its provisions related to pre-Business Combination activity (including the requirement not release the funds held in the Trust Account except in specified circumstances, and to provide redemption rights to Public Shareholders as described herein) may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock entitled to vote thereon and corresponding provisions of the Investment Management Trust Agreement governing the release of funds from our Trust Account may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock entitled to vote thereon. In all other instances, our Charter may be amended by holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock entitled to vote thereon, subject to applicable provisions of the MBCA or applicable stock exchange rules. Our Sponsor, which beneficially owns 40.3% of our common stock, may participate in any vote to amend our Charter and/or Investment Management Trust Agreement and will have the discretion to vote in any manner it chooses. As a result, we may be able to amend the provisions of our Charter which govern our pre-Business Combination behavior more easily than some other special purpose acquisition companies, and this may increase our ability to complete a Business Combination with which you do not agree. Our shareholders may pursue remedies against us for any breach of our Charter. Our Sponsor, executive officers, and directors have agreed, pursuant to written agreements with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our Charter to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete our initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, or with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders\u2019 rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity, unless we provide our Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A Shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares. Our shareholders are not parties to, or third-party beneficiaries of, these agreements and, as a result, will not have the ability to pursue remedies against our Sponsor, executive officers, directors for any breach of these agreements. As a result, in the event of a breach, our shareholders would need to pursue a shareholder derivative action, subject to applicable law. We may be unable to obtain additional financing to complete our initial Business Combination or to fund the operations and growth of a target business, which could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular Business Combination. We have not selected any specific Business Combination target but intend to target businesses with enterprise values that are greater than we could acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants. As a result, if the cash portion of the purchase price exceeds the amount available from the Trust Account, net of amounts needed to satisfy any redemption by Public Shareholders, we may be required to seek additional financing to complete such initial Business Combination. We cannot assure you that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to complete our initial Business Combination, we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular Business Combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. Further, we may be required to obtain additional financing in connection with the closing of our initial Business Combination for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial Business Combination, or to fund the purchase of other companies. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination, our Public Shareholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account that are available for distribution to Public Shareholders. In addition, even if we do not need additional financing to complete our initial Business Combination, we may require such financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. None of our officers, directors or shareholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial Business Combination. 32",

Our Sponsor owns 40.3% of our issued and outstanding common stock. Accordingly, the Sponsor may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a shareholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support, including amendments to our Charter. In addition, our board of directors, whose members were initially elected by our Sponsor, is divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. We have not and may not hold an annual meeting of shareholders to elect new directors prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination, in which case all of the current directors will continue in office until at least the completion of the Business Combination. If there is an annual meeting, as a consequence of our \u201cstaggered\u201d board of directors, only a minority of the board of directors will be considered for election and our initial shareholders, because of their ownership position, will have considerable influence regarding the outcome. Accordingly, our initial shareholders will continue to exert control at least until the completion of our initial Business Combination. Because we must furnish our shareholders with target business financial statements, we may lose the ability to complete an otherwise advantageous initial Business Combination with some prospective target businesses. The federal proxy rules require that the proxy statement with respect to the vote on an initial business combination include historical and pro forma financial statement disclosure. We will include the same financial statement disclosure in connection with our tender offer documents, whether or not they are required under the tender offer rules. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d), or international financial reporting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\u201cIFRS\u201d), depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d). These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such financial statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial Business Combination within the prescribed time frame. Compliance obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may make it more difficult for us to effectuate our initial Business Combination, require substantial financial and management resources, and increase the time and costs of completing an initial Business Combination. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls beginning with this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2023. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. Further, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. The fact that we are a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome on us as compared to other public companies because a target business with which we seek to complete our initial Business Combination may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of the internal control of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such Business Combination. Changes in laws or regulations or how such laws or regulations are interpreted or applied, or a failure to comply with any laws or regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial Business Combination, and results of operations. We are and will be subject to laws and regulations, and interpretations and applications of such laws and regulations enacted by national, regional, state and local governments and, potentially, foreign jurisdictions. In particular, we will be required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements, our Business Combination may be contingent on our ability to comply with certain laws, regulations, interpretations and applications and any post-Business Combination company may be subject to additional laws, regulations, interpretations and applications. Compliance with, and monitoring of, the foregoing may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time, including as a result of changes in economic, political, social and government policies, and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial Business Combination, and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial Business Combination, and results of operations. 33",

The 2024 SPAC Rules, among other items, impose additional disclosure requirements in initial public offerings by SPACs and business combination transactions involving SPACs and private operating companies; amend the financial statement requirements applicable to business combination transactions involving such companies; update and expand guidance regarding the general use of projections in SEC filings, as well as when projections are disclosed in connection with proposed business combination transactions; increase the potential liability of certain participants in proposed business combination transactions; and could impact the extent to which SPACs could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The 2024 SPAC Rules may materially adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete, and the costs associated with, our initial Business Combination, and results of operations. Risks Relating to our Sponsor, Advisors and Management Team We are dependent upon our executive officers and directors and their loss could adversely affect our ability to operate. Our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of individuals and, in particular, our executive officers and directors. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our officers and directors, at least until we have completed our initial Business Combination. In addition, our executive officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating their time among various business activities, including identifying potential Business Combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. We do not have an employment agreement with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any of our directors or executive officers. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our directors or executive officers could have a detrimental effect on us. Our ability to successfully effect our initial Business Combination and to be successful thereafter will be dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, some of whom may join us following our initial Business Combination. The loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. Our ability to successfully effect our initial Business Combination is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. The role of our key personnel in the target business, however, cannot presently be ascertained. Although some of our key personnel may remain with the target business in senior management or advisory positions following our initial Business Combination, it is likely that some or all of the management of the target business will remain in place. While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after our initial Business Combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a company regulated by the SEC, which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements. The officers and directors of an acquisition candidate may resign upon completion of our initial Business Combination. The loss of a Business Combination target\u2019s key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. The role of an acquisition candidate\u2019s key personnel upon the completion of our initial Business Combination cannot be ascertained at this time. Although we contemplate that certain members of an acquisition candidate\u2019s management team will remain associated with the acquisition candidate following our initial Business Combination, it is possible that members of the management of an acquisition candidate will not wish to remain in place. 34",

Our executive officers and directors are not required to, and will not, commit their full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and our search for a Business Combination and their other businesses. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination. Each of our executive officers is engaged in several other business endeavors for which he may be entitled to substantial compensation, and our executive officers are not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours per week to our affairs. Our independent directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities, including Coliseum Acquisition Corp.

If our executive officers\u2019 and directors\u2019 other business affairs require them to devote substantial amounts of time to such affairs in excess of their current commitment levels, it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs which may have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial Business Combination. Our officers and directors presently have, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. Since the completion of our initial public offering and until we consummate our initial Business Combination, we engage in the business of identifying and combining with one or more businesses. Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a Business Combination opportunity to such entity, including Coliseum, which is sponsored by affiliates of our Sponsor. Accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to another entity prior to its presentation to us. Our Charter provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation.

Coliseum raised $150 million in gross proceeds from an initial public offering in June 2021 and has a window in which it may complete its initial Business Combination that overlaps with the corresponding window we have. Further, Mr. You, our Chairman, serves as the Chairman of Coliseum and Mr. Wert, our director, serves as Chief Executive Officer and a director for Coliseum. Any such companies, including Coliseum, may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial Business Combination because our management team has significant experience in identifying and executing multiple acquisition opportunities simultaneously, and as we believe there are a number of potential opportunities within the industries and geographies of our primary focus. For a complete discussion of our executive officers\u2019 and directors\u2019 business affiliations and the potential conflicts of interest that you should be aware of, please see \u201cDirectors, Executive Officers, and Corporate Governance\u2014Directors and Executive Officers\u201d and \u201cDirectors, Executive Officers, and Corporate Governance\u2014Conflicts of Interest.\u201d Our executive officers, directors, security holders and their respective affiliates may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests. We have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, executive officers, security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary or financial interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. In fact, we may enter into a Business Combination with a target business that is affiliated with our Sponsor, our directors or executive officers, although we do not intend to do so. Nor do we have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. Accordingly, such persons or entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours. The personal and financial interests of our directors and officers may influence their motivation in timely identifying and selecting a target business and completing a Business Combination. Consequently, our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 discretion in identifying and selecting a suitable target business may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether the terms, conditions and timing of a particular Business Combination are appropriate and in our shareholders\u2019 best interest. If this were the case, it might be a breach of their fiduciary duties to us as a matter of Massachusetts law and we or our shareholders might have a claim against such individuals for infringing on our shareholders\u2019 rights. However, we might not ultimately be successful in any claim we may make against them for such reason. We may engage in a Business Combination with one or more target businesses that have relationships with entities that may be affiliated with our Sponsor, executive officers, directors or existing holders which may raise potential conflicts of interest. In light of the involvement of our Sponsor, executive officers and directors with other entities, we may decide to acquire one or more businesses affiliated with our Sponsor, executive officers, directors or existing holders. Our directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities, including, without limitation, those described under \u201cDirectors, Executive Officers, and Corporate Governance\u2014Conflicts of Interest.\u201d Such entities may compete with us for Business Combination opportunities. Our Sponsor, officers and directors are not currently aware of any specific opportunities for us to complete our initial Business Combination with any entities with which they are affiliated, and there have been no substantive discussions concerning a Business Combination with any such entity or entities. Although we will not be specifically focusing on, or targeting, any transaction with any affiliated entities, we would pursue such a transaction if we determined that such affiliated entity met our criteria for a Business Combination and such transaction was approved by a majority of our independent and disinterested directors. Despite our agreement to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm regarding the fairness to our company from a financial point of view of a Business Combination with one or more domestic or international businesses affiliated with our Sponsor, executive officers, directors or existing holders, potential conflicts of interest still may exist and, as a result, the terms of the Business Combination may not be as advantageous to our Public Shareholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest. 36",

These financial incentives may cause it to have potential conflicts of interest in rendering any such additional services to us, including, for example, in connection with the sourcing and consummation of an initial Business Combination. We may engage our underwriter or one of their respective affiliates to provide additional services to us, including, for example, identifying potential targets, providing financial advisory services, acting as a placement agent in a private offering or arranging debt financing. We may pay such underwriter or its affiliate fair and reasonable fees or other compensation that would be determined at that time in an arm\u2019s length negotiation. The underwriter is also entitled to receive deferred commissions that are conditioned on the completion of an initial Business Combination. The underwriter\u2019s or its respective affiliates\u2019 financial interests tied to the consummation of a Business Combination transaction may give rise to potential conflicts of interest in providing any such additional services to us, including potential conflicts of interest in connection with the sourcing and consummation of an initial Business Combination. Since our Sponsor, executive officers and directors will lose their entire investment in us if our initial Business Combination is not completed, a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular Business Combination target is appropriate for our initial Business Combination. On March 16, 2022, our Sponsor purchased an aggregate 2,875,000 Founder Shares for a total price of $25,000, or approximately $0.009 per share. On September 8, 2022, our Sponsor surrendered to us 718,750 Founder Shares for no consideration, resulting in our Sponsor owning 2,156,250 Founder Shares and increasing the approximate price paid per Founder Share to $0.012. On September 29, 2022, our Sponsor surrendered to us an additional 431,250 Founder Shares for no consideration, resulting in our Sponsor owning 1,725,000 Founder Shares and increasing the approximate price paid per Founder Share to $0.015. In addition, on October 11, 2022, further to the underwriter\u2019s partial exercise of the over-allotment option and forfeiture of the remaining amount, our Sponsor forfeited 145,250 Founder Shares. Mr. You, the manager of our Sponsor, has voting and investment discretion with respect to the common stock held by our Sponsor. Our Sponsor intends to transfer 25,000 Founder Shares to each of Darla Anderson, Francesca Luthi, Charles Wert and Constance Weaver, our independent directors, upon the completion of our initial Business Combination, resulting in our Sponsor holding at that time 1,625,000 Founder Shares. Prior to the initial investment in the company of $25,000 by our Sponsor, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible. The Founder Shares will be worthless if we do not complete an initial Business Combination. In addition, our Sponsor has purchased an aggregate of 2,884,660 Private Placement Warrants, each exercisable for one Class A Share at $11.50 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $2,884,660, or $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, that will also be worthless if we do not complete our initial Business Combination. In addition, the Sponsor and Mr. You have loaned to the Company an aggregate of $1,139,517 as of the date of this Form 10-K, consisting of Overfunding Loans and Contributions. If we do not complete our initial Business Combination, we will not repay the Overfunding Loans or Contributions from the funds held in the Trust Account, and we would likely not have other available funds outside of the Trust Account to repay the Overfunding Loans and Contributions in connection with the extensions. The personal and financial interests of our executive officers and directors may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target Business Combination, completing an initial Business Combination and influencing the operation of the business following the initial Business Combination. This risk may become more acute as the end of the Combination Period nears. Our management may not maintain control of a target business after our initial Business Combination. We cannot provide assurance that, upon loss of control of a target business, new management will possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business. We may structure our initial Business Combination so that the post-transaction company in which our Public Shareholders own shares will own less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business, but we will only complete such Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction that does not meet such criteria. Even if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post Business Combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the Business Combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new Class A Shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new Class A Shares, our shareholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding Class A Shares subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority shareholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company\u2019s shares than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not maintain control of the target business. 37",

Our Sponsor has invested in us an aggregate of $4,049,177, comprised of the $25,000 purchase price for the Founder Shares, the $2,884,660 purchase price for the Private Placement Warrants, the $947,850 Overfunding Loans and the $191,667 in Contributions made in connection to the Additional Extensions. Assuming a trading price of $10.00 per share upon consummation of our initial Business Combination, the 1,579,750 Founder Shares would have an aggregate implied value of $15,797,500. Even if the trading price of our common stock were as low as $1.91 per share, the value of the Founder Shares would be equal to the $2,909,660 invested by our Sponsor to purchase the Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants. As a result, our Sponsor is likely to be able to make a substantial profit on its investment in us at a time when our Public Shares have lost significant value (whether because of a substantial amount of redemptions of our Public Shares or any other reason). Accordingly, our management team, which owns interests in our Sponsor, may be more willing to pursue a Business Combination with a riskier or less-established target business than would be the case if our Sponsor had paid the same per share price for the Founder Shares as our Public Shareholders paid for their Public Shares. We may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders of Public Warrants with the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding Public Warrants. As a result, the exercise price of your warrants could be increased, the exercise period could be shortened and the number of Class A Shares purchasable upon exercise of a Public Warrant could be decreased, all without your approval. Our warrants were issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us.

Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the Public Warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding Public Warrants approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the Public Warrants with the consent of at least 50% of the then outstanding Public Warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, convert the warrants into cash or stock (at a ratio different than initially provided), shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of Class A Shares purchasable upon exercise of a warrant. 38",

Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our warrant agreement inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors. To the extent our warrants ever become exercisable, we may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless. To the extent our warrants ever become exercisable, we have the ability to redeem the outstanding Public Warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, provided that the closing price of our Class A Shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to proper notice of such redemption and provided that certain other conditions are met. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, we may redeem the warrants as set forth above even if the holders are otherwise unable to exercise the warrants. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you to (i) exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (iii) accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, we expect would be substantially less than the market value of your warrants. None of the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by our Sponsor or its permitted transferees. 39",

The value received upon exercise of the warrants (i) may be less than the value the holders would have received if they had exercised their warrants at a later time where the underlying share price is higher and (ii) may not compensate the holders for the value of the warrants, including because the number of Class A Shares received is capped at 0.361 Class A Shares per warrant (subject to adjustment) irrespective of the remaining life of the warrants. None of the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by our Sponsor or its permitted transferees. Our warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A Shares and make it more difficult to effectuate our initial Business Combination. We have issued warrants to purchase 3,159,500 Class A Shares as part of the initial public offering and, simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we have issued in a private placement an aggregate of 2,884,660 Private Placement Warrants, each exercisable to purchase one Class A Share at $11.50 per share. We have also issued a Convertible Note to an affiliate of our Sponsor in connection with the Contribution and advances our Sponsor may make in the future to us for working capital expenses, with a principal amount up to $1.75 million. Upon the consummation of our initial Business Combination, the outstanding principal of the Convertible Note may be converted into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant, at the option of the Payee. Any working capital loans, including the above Convertible Note, made by our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors, up to a total of $1,500,000, may be convertible into warrants of the post-Business Combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. To the extent we issue common stock to effectuate a business transaction, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional Class A Shares upon exercise of these warrants could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business. Such warrants, when exercised, will increase the number of issued and outstanding Class A Shares and reduce the value of the Class A Shares issued to complete the business transaction. Therefore, our warrants may make it more difficult to effectuate a business transaction or increase the cost of acquiring the target business. Our warrants are recognized and accounted for as derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC 815 and will be recorded at fair value upon issuance with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A Shares or may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial Business Combination. Following the consummation of our initial public offering and the concurrent issuance of the Private Placement of warrants to our Sponsor, 6,044,160 warrants were issued in connection with the initial public offering (comprised of the 3,159,500 warrants included in the units and the 2,884,660 Private Placement Warrants) in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40. Such guidance provides that because the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, each warrant must be recorded as a liability. Accordingly, we have classified each of the warrants as a liability at its fair value as determined by us based upon a valuation report obtained from an independent third party valuation firm. At each reporting period (1) the accounting treatment of the warrants is re-evaluated for proper accounting treatment as a liability or equity and (2) the fair value of the liability of the public and private warrants is remeasured and the change in the fair value of the liability is recorded as other income (expense) in our income statement. Changes in the inputs and assumptions for the valuation model we use to determine the fair value of such liability may have a material impact on the estimated fair value of the embedded derivative liability. The share price of our Class A Shares represents the primary underlying variable that impacts the value of the derivative instruments. Additional factors that impact the value of the derivative instruments include the volatility of our stock price, discount rates and stated interest rates. As a result, our consolidated financial statements and results of operations will fluctuate quarterly, based on various factors, such as the share price of our Class A Shares, many of which are outside of our control. In addition, we may change the underlying assumptions used in our valuation model, which could in result in significant fluctuations in our results of operations. If our stock price is volatile, we expect that we will recognize non-cash gains or losses on our warrants or any other similar derivative instruments each reporting period and that the amount of such gains or losses could be material. The impact of changes in fair value on earnings may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A Shares. In addition, potential targets may seek a blank check company that does not have warrants that are accounted for as a warrant liability, which may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial Business Combination with a target business. 40",

            "context": "Provisions in our Charter and Massachusetts law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our Class A Shares and could entrench management. Our Charter contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that shareholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include a staggered board of directors and the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock, which may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Massachusetts law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together these provisions may make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. The rights of the holders of our Class A Shares will be subject to, and may be harmed by, the rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. Massachusetts state law also prohibits us from engaging in specified Business Combinations unless the combination is approved or consummated in a prescribed manner. Provisions in our Charter and Massachusetts law may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. Our Charter requires, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, that the Business Litigation Session of the Superior Court for Suffolk County, Massachusetts and United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts sitting in Boston, Massachusetts shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (b) any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation to the corporation or the corporation\u2019s shareholders, (c) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the MBCA, the Charter, or the bylaws of the corporation, or (d) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to said courts having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein, except that the United States District Court of Massachusetts in Boston shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any claim arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any claim for which such other courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction including, without limitation, any claim arising under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the United States District Court of Massachusetts in Boston shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act against us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or agents. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions. Although we believe this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Massachusetts law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, the provision limits our shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us and may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. 41",

            "context": "In order not to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, unless we can qualify for an exclusion, we must ensure that we are engaged primarily in a business other than investing, reinvesting or trading of securities and that our activities do not include investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading \u201cinvestment securities\u201d constituting more than 40% of our assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. The SEC recently provided guidance that the determination of whether a special purpose acquisition company, like us, is an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the Investment Company Act is a facts and circumstances determination requiring individualized analysis and depends on a variety of factors, including a SPAC\u2019s duration, asset composition, business purpose and activities. When applying these factors to us we do not believe that our principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act. To this end, the Company was formed for the purpose of completing an initial Business Combination with one or more businesses. Since our inception, our business has been and will continue to be focused on identifying and completing an initial Business Combination, and thereafter, operating the post-transaction business or assets for the long term. Further, we do not plan to buy businesses or assets with a view to resale or profit from their resale and we do not plan to buy unrelated businesses or assets or to be a passive investor. The funds in the Trust Account may only be (i) held uninvested, (ii) held in an interest-bearing bank demand deposit account, or (iii) held in only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. government treasury obligations and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. The longer that the funds in the Trust Account are held in short-term U.S. government securities or in money market funds invested exclusively in such securities, even prior to the 24-month anniversary of the effective date of the registration statement relating to our initial public offering, there is a greater risk that we may be considered an unregistered investment company, in which case we may be required to liquidate. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, and by having a business plan targeted at acquiring and growing businesses for the long term (rather than on buying and selling businesses in the manner of a merchant bank or private equity fund), we intend to avoid being deemed an \u201cinvestment company\u201d within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. The Trust Account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earliest to occur of either: (i) the completion of our initial Business Combination; (ii) the redemption of any Public Shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our Charter to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete our initial Business Combination before the end of the Combination Period; and (iii) absent an initial Business Combination before the end of the Combination Period, or with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders\u2019 rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity, our return of the funds held in the Trust Account to our Public Shareholders as part of our redemption of the Public Shares. To further mitigate the risk of us being deemed to have been operating as an unregistered investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may, in our discretion, on or prior to the 24-month anniversary of the effective date of the registration statement relating to our initial public offering, or September 29, 2024, instruct Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the trustee with respect to the Trust Account, to liquidate the U.S. government treasury obligations or money market funds held in the Trust Account and thereafter to hold all funds in the Trust Account in cash through a variable interest bearing account until the earlier of the consummation of a business combination or our liquidation. Following such liquidation of the assets in our Trust Account, we will likely receive minimal interest, if any, on the funds held in the Trust Account, which would reduce the dollar amount our Public Shareholders would otherwise receive upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company if the assets in the Trust Account had remained in U.S. government securities or money market funds. This means that the amount available for redemption may not increase in the future. 44",

We also may be forced to abandon our efforts to complete an initial Business Combination and instead be required to liquidate the Trust Account. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination, our Public Shareholders would not be able to realize the benefits of owning shares in a successor operating business, including the potential appreciation in the value of our securities following such a Business Combination, and may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account that are available for distribution to Public Shareholders. We may be subject to the Excise Tax included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 in the event of a liquidation or in connection with redemptions of our common stock after December 31, 2022. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (H.R. 5376) (the \u201cIRA\u201d), which, among other things, imposes a new 1% U.S. federal excise tax on certain repurchases (including certain redemptions) of stock by publicly traded domestic (i.e. U.S.) corporations and certain domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign (i.e., non-U.S.) corporations (each, a \u201cCovered Corporation\u201d) (the \u201cExcise Tax\u201d). Because we are a Massachusetts corporation and our securities are trading on NYSE American, we are a \u201ccovered corporation\u201d within the meaning of the IR Act The Excise Tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the Excise Tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the Excise Tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the Excise Tax. On December 27, 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the \u201cTreasury\u201d) published Notice 2023-2, which provided clarification on some aspects of the application of the Excise Tax, including with respect to some transactions in which SPACs typically engage. In the notice, the Treasury appears to have intended to exempt from the Excise Tax any distributions by a covered corporation in the same year it completely liquidates, which may include those that occur in connection with redemptions, but such guidance is far from clear. On June 29, 2023, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service issued Announcement 2023-18, which provides that, prior to the time specified in the forthcoming regulations, taxpayers are not required to report or pay the Excise Tax. However, this suspension of the reporting and payment of the Excise Tax is temporary. Consequently, a substantial risk remains that any redemptions by us, including those made in connection with the Extension, would be subject to the Excise Tax, including in circumstances where we either engage in a business combination in 2024 in which we do not issue shares sufficient to offset our redemptions in 2024 or we liquidate later in 2024. Because the application of the Excise Tax is not entirely clear, any repurchase effected by us, including any redemptions treated as repurchases in connection with the Extension, the initial business combination or otherwise, may be subject to the Excise Tax. Whether and to what extent we would be subject to the Excise Tax on a redemption of Public Shares or other stock issued by us would depend on a number of factors, including (i) whether the redemption is treated as a repurchase of stock for purposes of the Excise Tax, (ii) the fair market value of the redemption treated as a repurchase of stock in connection with our initial business combination, the Extension or otherwise (iii) the structure of the initial business combination, (iv) the nature and amount of any \u201cPIPE\u201d or other equity issuances by us (whether in connection with the initial business combination or otherwise) within the same taxable year of a redemption treated as a repurchase of stock, and (v) the content of forthcoming regulations and other guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Excise Tax would be payable by us, and not by the redeeming holder, and the mechanics of any required reporting and payment of the Excise Tax have not yet been determined. Funds in our Trust Account, including any interest earned thereon, will not be used to pay for any Excise Tax liabilities with respect to any redemptions that occur prior to or in connection with a business combination or liquidation of the Company. The imposition of the Excise Tax could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete an initial business combination or for effecting redemptions and may affect our ability to complete an initial business combination. 45",

If the issuance of the Class A Shares upon exercise of the warrants is not registered, qualified or exempt from registration or qualification under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, holders of warrants will not be entitled to exercise such warrants and such warrants may have no value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of units will have paid the full unit purchase price solely for the Class A Shares included in the units. We have not registered the Class A Shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. However, under the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed that, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days, after the closing of our initial Business Combination, we will use our best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement covering the registration under the Securities Act of the Class A Shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and thereafter will use our best efforts to cause the same to become effective within 60 business days following our initial Business Combination and to maintain a current prospectus relating to the Class A Shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so if, for example, any facts or events arise which represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement or prospectus, the financial statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current or correct or the SEC issues a stop order. If the Class A Shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act, under the terms of the warrant agreement, holders of warrants who seek to exercise their warrants will not be permitted to do so for cash and, instead, will be required to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. In no event will warrants be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration or qualification is available. If our Class A Shares are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of \u201ccovered securities\u201d under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, not permit holders of warrants who seek to exercise their warrants to do so for cash and, instead, require them to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act; in the event we so elect, we will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement or register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under applicable state securities laws, and in the event we do not so elect, we will use our best efforts to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under applicable state securities laws to the extent an exemption is not available. In no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant, or issue securities (other than upon a cashless exercise as described above) or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws. You may only be able to exercise your Public Warrants on a \u201ccashless basis\u201d under certain circumstances, and if you do so, you will receive fewer Class A Shares from such exercise than if you were to exercise such warrants for cash. The warrant agreement provides that in the following circumstances holders of warrants who seek to exercise their warrants will not be permitted to do for cash and will, instead, be required to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act: (i) if the Class A Shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act in accordance with the terms of the warrant agreement; and (ii) if we have so elected and the Class A Shares at the time of any exercise of a warrant are not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of \u201ccovered securities\u201d under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act. If you exercise your Public Warrants on a cashless basis under the circumstances described in clauses (i) and (ii) in the preceding sentence, you would pay the warrant exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of Class A Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of Class A Shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the \u201cfair market value\u201d of our Class A Shares (as defined in the next sentence) over the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the fair market value. The \u201cfair market value\u201d is the average reported closing price of the Class A Shares for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of exercise is received by the warrant agent or on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants, as applicable. As a result, you would receive fewer Class A Shares from such exercise than if you were to exercise such warrants for cash. 46",

The registration and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A Shares. In addition, the existence of the registration rights may make our initial Business Combination more costly or difficult to conclude. This is because the shareholders of the target business may increase the equity stake they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on the market price of our Class A Shares that is expected when the shares of common stock owned by our initial shareholders, holders of our Private Placement Warrants or holders of our working capital loans or their respective permitted transferees are registered.

Any such issuances would dilute the interest of our shareholders and likely present other risks. Our Charter authorizes the issuance of up to 35,000,000 Class A Shares, 5,000,000 Class B Shares, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock.

Sophisticated and deliberate attacks on, or security breaches in, our systems or infrastructure, or the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud, could lead to corruption or misappropriation of our assets, proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. As an early stage company without significant investments in data security protection, we may not be sufficiently protected against such occurrences. We may not have sufficient resources to adequately protect against, or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to, cyber incidents. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have adverse consequences on our business and lead to financial loss. We are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies or smaller reporting companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies. We are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor internal controls attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our shareholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our Class A Shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile. 49",

The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. Additionally, we are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. Our status as a smaller reporting company is determined annually. We will continue to qualify as a smaller reporting company through the following fiscal year as long as (i) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates (measured as of the end of the second quarter of the then current fiscal year) does not exceed $250 million or (ii) our annual revenues for the most recently completed fiscal year do not exceed $100 million and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates (measured as of the end of the second quarter of the then current fiscal year) does not exceed $700 million.

At the Special Meeting on January 2, 2024, the Company\u2019s shareholders approved an amendment to the Investment Management Trust Agreement, permitting the trustee to, in a timely manner, upon the written instruction of the Company, (i) hold funds uninvested, (ii) hold funds in an interest-bearing bank demand deposit account, or (iii) invest and reinvest the Property in solely United States government securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, having a maturity of 185 days or less, or in money market funds meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. The trustee is not permitted to invest in other securities or assets. Investing in our securities is not intended for persons who are seeking a return on investments in government securities or investment securities. Instead, the Trust Account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the use of such funds upon completion of a Business Combination or distribution upon redemption of our Public Shares. Our management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the initial public offering and the sale of Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that we will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. We must complete one or more initial Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes and excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination. However, we will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We provide our Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholders\u2019 meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then held in the Trust Account. The per-share amount to be distributed to Public Shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriter. We initially had 15 months from the closing of the initial public offering, or January 4, 2024, to consummate an initial Business Combination. On January 2, 2024, the Company held a Special Meeting. At the Special Meeting, the Company\u2019s shareholders approved an amendment of the Company\u2019s Charter to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a Business Combination up to twenty-three (23) times for an additional one (1) month each time from January 4, 2024 to January 29, 2024 and to allow the Company, without another shareholder vote, by resolution of the board of directors, to elect to further extend the Extended Date up to twenty-three times for an additional one month each time, until up to December 29, 2025, only if the Sponsor or its designee would deposit into the Trust Account as a loan, (i) on or before January 4, 2024, with respect to the initial extension, an amount of $41,667, and (ii) one business day following the public announcement by us disclosing that the board of directors has determined to implement an additional monthly extension, with respect to each such Additional Extension, an amount of $50,000.

Upon the consummation of our initial Business Combination, the outstanding principal of the Convertible Note may be converted into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant, at the option of the Payee. Since January 2, 2024, our board of directors has elected to extend our liquidation date to April 29, 2024. Accordingly, we have drawn down from the Convertible Note and deposited $191,667 into the Trust Account in connection with such extension. If we are unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem one hundred percent (100%) of the Offering Shares in consideration of a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest not previously released to the Corporation to pay its taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), by (B) the total number of then outstanding Offering Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish rights of the Public Shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Board in accordance with applicable law, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Corporation\u2019s obligations under the MBCA to provide for claims of creditors and other requirements of applicable law. Going Concern Consideration As of December 31, 2023, we had de minimis cash and working capital deficit of approximately $2.0 million (including tax obligations of approximately $885,000 that may be paid using investment income earned in Trust Account). Further, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans. On March 3, 2022, the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company an aggregate amount of up to $200,000 to cover expenses related to the Initial Public Offering pursuant to a promissory note (the \u201cNote\u201d). Prior to the consummation of the initial public offering, our liquidity needs were satisfied through the payment of $25,000 from our Sponsor to purchase Founder Shares and a loan under the Note in the amount of approximately $145,000. The Company fully repaid the Note balance on October 4, 2022. The Note was no longer available to the Company after closing of its initial public offering. Subsequent to the closing of the initial public offering, our liquidity needs have been satisfied through the net proceeds from the consummation of the initial public offering and the Private Placement Warrants held outside of the Trust Account and advances from related parties totaling approximately $185,000 as of December 31, 2023. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, the Company borrowed an additional amount of approximately $155,000 from related parties, and then paid back approximately $167,000, reducing the total advances amount outstanding to approximately $173,000. 55",

From January through March 2024, the Company borrowed $191,667 under the Convertible Note and contributed such amount into the Trust Account in connection with extensions to extend the Combination Period to April 29, 2024. In connection with our management\u2019s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB\u2019s Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2014-15, \u201cDisclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,\u201d our management has determined that the liquidity condition, mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through the earlier of the liquidation date or the completion of the initial Business Combination. There is no assurance that our plans to consummate the initial Business Combination will be successful or successful within the Combination Period. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Risks and Uncertainties In February 2022, the Russian Federation and Belarus commenced a military action with the country of Ukraine. As a result of this action, various nations, including the United States, have instituted economic sanctions against the Russian Federation and Belarus. Further, the impact of this action and related sanctions on the world economy are not determinable as of the date of the financial statements. The specific impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is also not determinable as of the date of these financial statements. On October 7, 2023, Hamas militants and members of other terrorist organizations infiltrated Israel\u2019s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of terror attacks on civilian and military targets. The intensity and duration of Israel\u2019s current war against Hamas is difficult to predict, and as are such war\u2019s economic implications on the Company\u2019s business and operations and on Israel\u2019s economy in general. The specific impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is also not determinable as of the date of these financial statements. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the \u201cIR Act\u201d) was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a U.S. federal 1% excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. Any share redemption or other share repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2023, in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax on a redemption of Public Shares or other stock of the Company in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise will depend on a number of factors, including (i) whether the redemption is treated as a repurchase of stock for purposes of the excise tax, (ii) the fair market value of the redemption treated as a repurchase of stock in connection with the Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a Business Combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of a redemption treated as a repurchase of stock) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. As noted above, because the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not by the redeeming holder. The imposition of the excise tax has not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete a Business Combination or for effecting redemptions and may affect in the Company\u2019s ability to complete a Business Combination. 56",

            "context": "On December 27, 2022, the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) issued a Notice 2023-2 (\u201cNotice\u201d), which provided interim guidance regarding the application of the corporate stock repurchase excise tax until the issuance of proposed regulations. The Notice excluded the distributions upon complete liquidation of a corporation from the base of the excise tax. The Notice also excludes from the scope of the excise tax any distribution made during the taxable year in which a corporation fully liquidates and dissolves, even if a distribution precedes the formal decision to liquidate. Although such Notice clarifies certain aspects of the excise tax, the interpretation and operation of other aspects of the excise tax remain unclear, and such interim operating rules are subject to change. Results of Operations Our entire activity from February 15, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2023 is related to our formation and the preparation for our initial public offering, and since the closing of our initial public offering, the search for a prospective initial Business Combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial Business Combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of investment income from the Trust Account. We will continue to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. Additionally, we recognize non-cash gains and losses within other income (expense) related to changes in recurring fair value measurement of our derivative liabilities at each reporting period. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we had net income of approximately $2.3 million, which consisted of approximately $1.6 million of the change in fair value of the derivative warrant liabilities and approximately $3.1 million of interest income from operating account and investments held in Trust Account, partially offset by approximately $1.5 million of general and administrative expenses (of which $120,000 was for administrative expenses paid to our Sponsor) and approximately $947,000 of tax expenses. For the period from February 15, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022, we had net loss of approximately $2.4 million, which consisted of approximately $933,000 of general and administrative expenses, approximately $156,000 of corporate tax expense, approximately $86,000 in income tax expense, approximately $1.8 million of the change in fair value of the derivative warrant liabilities and approximately $27,000 of offering costs associated with derivative warrant liabilities, partially offset by approximately $566,000 of interest income from operating account and investments held in Trust Account. Contractual Obligations Administrative Services Agreement On October 4, 2022, we entered into an agreement pursuant to which we agreed to pay our Sponsor $10,000 per month for office space, administrative and support services. Upon completion of a Business Combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. We recorded $120,000 and $30,000 in connection with such fees during the year ended December 31, 2023 and during the period from February 15, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022 in the accompanying statements of operations, respectively. We prepaid $150,000 in connection with such fees and had an unused balance of $50,000 in prepaid expenses recorded in the accompanying balance sheets as of December 31, 2022. Such prepaid amount was used up and as of December 31, 2023, we recorded an outstanding balance of $70,000 in connection with such fees in accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet. 57",

Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our Sponsor, executive officers or directors, or our or their affiliates. Registration Rights The holders of Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans and the Contributions (and any shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants or warrants issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans and the Contributions and upon conversion of the Founder Shares and the Overfunding Loans), will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration and shareholder rights agreement signed upon the consummation of the initial public offering. These holders will be entitled to certain demand and \u201cpiggyback\u201d registration rights. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Underwriting Agreement The underwriter was entitled to an underwriting discount of $0.14 per unit, or approximately $0.8 million in the aggregate, paid upon the closing of the initial public offering. An additional fee of $0.35 per unit, or $2.1 million in the aggregate will be payable to the underwriter for deferred underwriting commissions. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. The underwriter was entitled to an additional fee of approximately $45,000, which was paid upon closing of the over-allotment option, and approximately $112,000 in deferred underwriting commissions in connection with the consummation of the underwriter\u2019s partial exercise of its over-allotment option. Overfunding Loans Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, the Sponsor extended the Overfunding Loan to the Company in an aggregate amount of $900,000. On October 11, 2022, simultaneously with the sale of the Over-Allotment Units, the Sponsor extended the Additional Overfunding Loan to the Company in an amount of $47,850, for an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $947,850 to be deposited in the Trust Account. Upon the closing of the initial Business Combination, the Overfunding Loans will be repaid or converted into Class A Shares at a conversion price of $10.00 per share (or a combination of both), at the Sponsor\u2019s discretion. If the Company does not complete an initial Business Combination, it will not repay the Overfunding Loans from amounts held in the Trust Account, and its proceeds will be distributed to the Public Shareholders; however, the Company may repay the Overfunding Loans if there are funds available outside the Trust Account to do so. Convertible Promissory Note In connection with the Contribution and advances our Sponsor may make in the future to our company for working capital expenses, on January 2, 2024, we issued a Convertible Note to an affiliate of our Sponsor with a principal amount up to $1.75 million. The Convertible Note bears no interest and is repayable in full upon the earlier of (a) the date of the consummation of our initial Business Combination, or (b) the date of our liquidation. If we do not consummate an initial Business Combination by the end of the Combination Period, the Convertible Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. Upon the consummation of our initial Business Combination, the outstanding principal of the Convertible Note may be converted into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant, at the option of the New Sponsor. Such warrants will have terms identical to the Private Placement Warrants. From January through March 2024, we borrowed $191,667 under the Convertible Note and contributed such amount into the Trust Account in connection with extensions to extend the Combination Period. 58",

            "context": "The option to convert the Convertible Note into warrants qualifies as an embedded derivative under ASC 815 and is required to be recognized at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in our statements of operations each reporting period until the Convertible Note is repaid or converted. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: Warrant Liabilities The warrants issued in connection with Public Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants were recognized as derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC 815. Accordingly, we recognized the warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and will adjust the instruments to fair value at each reporting period. The liabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value will be recognized in the statements of operations. The fair value of the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants were initially measured at fair value using the Black-Scholes model and the Monte Carlo simulation model, respectively. Beginning in December 2022, the fair value of Public Warrants has been measured based on the listed market price of such Public Warrants. The estimated fair value of the Private Placement Warrants was subsequently determined using the Monte Carlo simulation method with Level 3 inputs. The determination of the fair value of the derivative warrant liabilities may be subject to change as more current information becomes available and accordingly the actual results could differ significantly Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2023, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(b)(1) of Regulation S-K and did not have any commitments or contractual obligations. JOBS Act On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act and are allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We elected to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. As an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, we are not required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor\u2019s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO\u2019s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our initial public offering or until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d whichever is earlier. 59",

Mr. Wert\u2019s qualifications to serve on our board of directors include his track record and leadership experience at GTY, Evercore, U.S. Trust Company N.A. and United Mercantile Bank and Trust Company. Number and Terms of Office of Officers and Directors Our board of directors consists of six members and is divided into three classes with only one class of directors being elected in each year, and with each class (except for those directors appointed prior to our first annual meeting of shareholders) serving a three-year term. In accordance with the NYSE American corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual meeting until one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on the NYSE American. We have not and may not hold an annual meeting of shareholders to elect new directors prior to the consummation of our initial Business Combination. The Company\u2019s first annual meeting of shareholders would be held at a future date to be determined by the post-Business Combination company. The term of office of the first class of directors, consisting of Ms. Anderson and Ms. Luthi, will expire at our first annual meeting of shareholders. The term of office of the second class of directors, consisting of Ms. Weaver and Mr. Wert, will expire at the second annual meeting of shareholders. The term of office of the third class of directors, consisting of Mr. You and Mr. de Masi, will expire at the third annual meeting of shareholders. Our officers are appointed by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms of office. Our board of directors is authorized to appoint officers as it deems appropriate pursuant to our Charter. Committees of the Board of Directors Our board of directors have three standing committees: an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee. The rules of the NYSE American and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act require that the audit committee consist of three members, all of whom must be independent directors, and compensation committee be comprised of at least two members, all of whom must be independent directors. 64",

Our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and any Public Shares they hold in connection with the completion of our initial Business Combination. The other members of our management team have entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by our initial shareholders with respect to any Public Shares acquired by them in or after our initial public offering. Additionally, our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Founder Shares if we fail to complete our initial Business Combination within the Combination Period. If we do not complete our initial Business Combination within the prescribed time frame, the Private Placement Warrants will not have redemption rights and there will be no liquidating distributions with respect to our Private Placement Warrants. Furthermore, our initial shareholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of: (i) one year after the completion of our initial Business Combination and (ii) the date following the completion of our initial Business Combination on which we complete a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their common stock for cash, securities or other property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the closing price of our Class A Shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial Business Combination, the Founder Shares will be released from the lockup. Subject to certain limited exceptions, the Private Placement Warrants will not be transferable until 30 days following the completion of our initial Business Combination. Because each of our executive officers and directors will own common stock or warrants directly or indirectly, they may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial Business Combination. Our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular Business Combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial Business Combination. We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial Business Combination with a Business Combination target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors or completing the Business Combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial Business Combination with a Business Combination target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm, that such initial Business Combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. Furthermore, in no event will our Sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, be paid by the company any finder\u2019s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial Business Combination. Further, commencing on the date our securities were first listed on the NYSE American, we have been paying our Sponsor $10,000 per month for office space, secretarial and administrative services provided to members of our management team. We cannot assure you that any of the above mentioned conflicts will be resolved in our favor. In the event that we submit our initial Business Combination to our Public Shareholders for a vote, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their Founder Shares, and they and the other members of our management team have agreed to vote any Founder Shares they hold and any Public Shares purchased during or after our initial public offering in favor of our initial Business Combination. Limitation on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors Our Charter provides that our officers and directors will be indemnified by us to the fullest extent authorized by Massachusetts law, as it now exists or may in the future be amended. In addition, our Charter provides that our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages to us or our shareholders for breaches of their fiduciary duty as directors, except that this does not eliminate or limit their liability for breach of their fiduciary duty of loyalty to us or our shareholders, for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, under the MBCA, or for any transaction from which the they derive an improper personal benefit. 69",

Our Charter also permits us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director or employee for any liability arising out of his or her actions, to the fullest extent permitted by the MBCA and applicable law. We have purchased a policy of directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance that insures our officers and directors against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify our officers and directors. Except with respect to any Public Shares they may have acquired in our initial public offering or thereafter (in the event we do not consummate an initial Business Combination), our officers and directors have agreed to waive (and any other persons who may become an officer or director prior to the initial Business Combination will also be required to waive) any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account, and not to seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason whatsoever, including with respect to such indemnification. These provisions may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our shareholders. Furthermore, a shareholder\u2019s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions.

However, these individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable Business Combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our Sponsor, officers, directors or our or their affiliates. Contributions In connection with the Contribution and advances the Sponsor may make in the future to the Company for working capital expenses, on January 2, 2024, the Company issued a convertible promissory note to Harry L. You, Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of the Company and an affiliate of the Sponsor, with a principal amount up to $1.75 million. The Convertible Note bears no interest and is repayable on the earlier of: (i) the date on which the Company consummates an initial Business Combination and (ii) the liquidation date. If the Company does not consummate a Business Combination before the end of the Combination Period, the Convertible Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. Upon the consummation of the Company\u2019s initial Business Combination, the outstanding principal of the Convertible Note may be converted into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant, at the option of the Payee. Since January 2, 2024, our board of directors has elected to extend our liquidation date to April 29, 2024. Accordingly, we have drawn down from the Convertible Note and deposited $191,667 into the Trust Account in connection with such extension. Working Capital Loans In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business, our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required on a non-interest basis. If we complete an initial Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such working capital loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-Business Combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. Except as set forth above, the terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. Prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our Trust Account. Any of the foregoing payments to our Sponsor, repayments of loans from our Sponsor or repayments of working capital loans prior to our initial Business Combination will be made using funds held outside the Trust Account. After our initial Business Combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our shareholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, furnished to our shareholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of distribution of such tender offer materials or at the time of a shareholder meeting held to consider our initial Business Combination, as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation. Registration Rights Agreement The holders of the (i) Founder Shares, which were issued in a Private Placement prior to the closing of our initial public offering, (ii) Private Placement Warrants, which were issued in a Private Placement simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering and the Class A Shares underlying such Private Placement Warrants, (iii) Private Placement Warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans and Contributions, and (iv) the Class A Shares issuable upon conversion of the Overfunding Loans will have registration rights to require us to register a sale of any of our securities held by them prior to the consummation of our initial Business Combination pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be signed prior to or on the effective date of our initial public offering. Pursuant to the registration rights agreement and assuming $1,500,000 of working capital loans are converted into Private Placement Warrants, we will be obligated to register up to 8,257,400 Class A Shares and 5,729,800 warrants. The number of Class A Shares includes (i) 1,579,750 Class A Shares to be issued upon conversion of the Founder Shares, (ii) 947,850 Class A Shares to be issued upon conversion of the Overfunding Loans, (iii) 2,966,000 Class A Shares underlying the Private Placement Warrants, and (iv) 1,500,000 Class A Shares underlying the Private Placement Warrants issued upon conversion of working capital loans. The number of warrants includes (i) 2,966,000 Private Placement Warrants, and (ii) 1,500,000 Private Placement Warrants issued upon conversion of working capital loans. The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain \u201cpiggy-back\u201d registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our completion of our initial Business Combination. 74",

Pursuant to the policy, the audit committee will consider (i) the relevant facts and circumstances of each related party transaction, including if the transaction is on terms comparable to those that could be obtained in arm\u2019s-length dealings with an unrelated third party, (ii) the extent of the related party\u2019s interest in the transaction, (iii) whether the transaction contravenes our code of ethics or other policies, (iv) whether the audit committee believes the relationship underlying the transaction to be in the best interests of the company and its shareholders and (v) the effect that the transaction may have on a director\u2019s status as an independent member of the board of directors and on his or her eligibility to serve on the board\u2019s committees. Management will present to the audit committee each proposed related party transaction, including all relevant facts and circumstances relating thereto. Under the policy, we may consummate related party transactions only if our audit committee approves or ratifies the transaction in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the policy. The policy will not permit any director or executive officer to participate in the discussion of, or decision concerning, a related person transaction in which he or she is the related party. Director Independence The rules of the NYSE American require that a majority of our board of directors be independent within one year of our initial public offering. An \u201cindependent director\u201d is defined generally as a person that, in the opinion of the company\u2019s board of directors, has no material relationship with the listed company (either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the company). We have four \u201cindependent directors\u201d as defined in the NYSE American rules and applicable SEC rules. Our board of directors has determined that each of Ms. Anderson, Ms. Weaver, Ms. Luthi and Mr. Wert is an independent director under applicable NYSE American and SEC rules. Our independent directors have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present. 75",

(the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related statements of operations, changes in shareholders\u2019 deficit and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the period from February 15, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the period from February 15, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, if the Company is unable to complete a business combination by April 29, 2024 then the Company will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. The date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Management\u2019s plans in regard to this matter are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ WithumSmith+Brown, PC We have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2022.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2023 Note 1\u2014Description of Organization and Business Operations dMY Squared Technology Group, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a blank check company incorporated in Massachusetts. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the \u201cBusiness Combination\u201d). The Company is an emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with emerging growth companies. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from February 15, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2023 relates to the Company\u2019s formation and the initial public offering (the \u201cInitial Public Offering\u201d) as described below, and since the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the search for a prospective initial Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company generates non-operating income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. The Company\u2019s sponsor is dMY Squared Sponsor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the \u201cSponsor\u201d). The registration statement for the Company\u2019s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on September 29, 2022. On October 4, 2022, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering of 6,000,000 units (the \u201cunits\u201d and, with respect to the Class A common stock included in the units offered, the \u201cClass A Shares\u201d or the \u201cPublic Shares\u201d), at $ 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $ 60.0 million, and incurring offering costs of approximately $ 3.7 million, of which $ 2.1 million and approximately $ 26,000 were for deferred underwriting commissions (see Note 5) and offering costs allocated to derivate warrant liabilities, respectively. On October 7, 2022, the underwriter exercised its over-allotment option in part, and on October 11, 2022, the underwriter purchased 319,000 additional units (the \u201cOver-Allotment Units\u201d), generating gross proceeds of approximately $ 3.2 million (the \u201cPartial Over-Allotment\u201d). The underwriter waived the remainder of its over-allotment option. The Company incurred additional offering costs of approximately $ 156,000 in connection with the Partial Over-Allotment (of which approximately $ 112,000 was for deferred underwriting fees). Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private placement (\u201cPrivate Placement\u201d) of 2,840,000 warrants (the \u201cInitial Private Placement Warrants\u201d), at a price of $ 1.00 per Initial Private Placement Warrant to the Sponsor, generating proceeds of approximately $ 2.8 million (see Note 4). On October 11, 2022, simultaneously with the issuance and sale of the Over-Allotment Units, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 44,660 private placement warrants at $ 1.00 per private placement warrant (the \u201cAdditional Private Placement Warrants\u201d, and together with the Initial Private Placement Warrants, the \u201cPrivate Placement Warrants\u201d), generating additional gross proceeds of approximately $ 45,000 . In addition, concurrently with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor extended an overfunding loan to the Company in an amount of $ 900,000 at no interest (the \u201cInitial Overfunding Loan\u201d) to deposit in the Trust Account (as defined below). On October 11, 2022, simultaneously with the sale of the Over-Allotment Units, the Sponsor extended a further overfunding loan to the Company in an aggregate amount of $ 47,850 (the \u201cAdditional Overfunding Loan\u201d, and together with the Initial Overfunding Loan, the \u201cOverfunding Loans\u201d) to deposit in the Trust Account. Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Partial Over-Allotment, the Private Placement and the Overfunding Loans, approximately $ 64.1 million ($ 10.15 per unit) of the net proceeds of the sale of the units and the Private Placement Warrants and the proceeds from the Overfunding Loans were placed in a trust account (the \u201cTrust Account\u201d) with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and was invested in United States government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting certain conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of (i) the completion of a Business Combination, (ii) the redemption of Public Shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our Amended and Restated Articles of Organization to modify the substance or timing of our of our obligation to redeem 100 % of our Public Shares if we do not complete our initial Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below) or with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders\u2019 rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity, and (iii) our return of the funds held in the Trust Account to our Public Shareholders as part of our redemption of the Public Shares if we do not complete an initial Business Combination during the Combination Period. F-6 The Company\u2019s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company must complete one or more initial Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 % of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes and excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination. However, the Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. The Company provides Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholders\u2019 meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then held in the Trust Account (initially at $ 10.15 per Public Share). The per-share amount to be distributed to Public Shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriter (as discussed in Note 5). These Public Shares are recorded at redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 480, \u201cDistinguishing Liabilities from Equity\u201d (\u201cASC 480\u201d). The Company will proceed with a Business Combination if a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. The Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Articles of Organization (the \u201cCharter\u201d) initially required the Company to not redeem the Public Shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets to be less than $ 5,000,001 . In January 2024, the shareholders approved the proposal to amend the Charter and eliminate such Redemption Limitation (as defined below). If a shareholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Charter, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the initial shareholders agreed to vote their Founder Shares (as defined below in Note 4) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination. In addition, the initial shareholders agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and Public Shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination. The Company\u2019s Charter provides that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15 % or more of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company. The Sponsor and the Company\u2019s officers agreed not to propose an amendment to the Charter to modify the substance or timing of the Company\u2019s obligation to redeem 100 % of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, or with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders\u2019 rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity, unless the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment.

            "context": "The Company\u2019s Charter initially provided 15 months from the closing of the initial public offering, or January 4, 2024 (the \u201cPrior Outside Date\u201d), to consummate an initial Business Combination. The Charter also permitted the Company, by resolution of the board of directors, to extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination twice by an additional 3-month period (for a total of 21 months to complete a Business Combination), subject to the Sponsor depositing into the Trust Account $ 631,900 in the aggregate for each extension (the \u201cPrior Contributions\u201d). The Sponsor did not intend to deposit such Prior Contributions into the Trust Account. Accordingly, following January 4, 2024, the Company would have been forced to liquidate. The Company\u2019s board determined that, in order for the Company to have additional time to complete a Business Combination in a more cost effective manner, it would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to extend the Prior Outside Date to allow for a period of additional time to consummate the Business Combination. On January 2, 2024, the Company held a special meeting of its shareholders (the \u201cSpecial Meeting\u201d). At the Special Meeting, the Company\u2019s shareholders approved an amendment of the Charter to extend (the \u201cExtension\u201d) the date by which the Company has to consummate a Business Combination up to twenty-three (23) times for an additional one (1) month each time (each, an \u201cExtension Period\u201d), with the first Extension Period being from January 4, 2024 to January 29, 2024 (the \u201cExtended Date\u201d) and each subsequent Extension Period being one calendar month each time, until up to December 29, 2025 (each, an \u201cAdditional Extended Date\u201d, and such period in its entirety, from the initial public offering until the final Additional Extended Date, the \u201cCombination Period\u201d), only if the Sponsor or its designee would deposit (the \u201cContribution\u201d) into the Trust Account as a loan, (i) on or before January 4, 2024, with respect to the initial extension to the Extended Date, an amount of $ 41,667 , and (ii) one business day following the public announcement by us disclosing that the board of directors has determined to implement an additional monthly extension, with respect to each such Extension Period, an amount of $ 50,000 . In connection with the shareholder approval of the Extension, an aggregate of 3,980,414 Public Shares were redeemed, and the Company paid approximately $ 42 million accordingly on January 4, 2024. At the Special Meeting, the Company\u2019s shareholders also approved proposals to (1) amend the Charter to provide for the right of a holder of Class B Shares to convert their Class B Shares into Class A Shares on a one-for-one basis at any time and from time to time at the election of the holder; (2) amend the Charter to eliminate from the Charter (i) the limitation that the Company may not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets to be less than $ 5,000,001 and (ii) the limitation that the Company shall not consummate a Business Combination unless it has net tangible assets of at least $ 5,000,001 ; (3) amend the Charter to permit the board of directors, in its sole discretion, to elect to wind up operations on an earlier date than the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable, as determined by the board of directors and included in a public announcement (the \u201cLiquidation Amendment\u201d); and (4) amend the Investment Management Trust Agreement between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company to reflect the Extension and the Liquidation Amendment. In connection with the Contribution and advances the Sponsor may make in the future to the Company for working capital expenses, on January 2, 2024, the Company issued a convertible promissory note to Harry L. You, Chairman and Chief Financial Officer and an affiliate of the Sponsor (the \u201cPayee\u201d), with a principal amount up to $ 1.75 million (the \u201cConvertible Note\u201d). The Convertible Note bears no interest and is repayable on the earlier of (i) the date on which the Company consummates an initial Business Combination and (ii) the liquidation date. If the Company does not consummate a Business Combination before the end of the Combination Period, the Convertible Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. Upon the consummation of the initial Business Combination, the outstanding principal of the Convertible Note may be converted into warrants, at a price of $ 1.00 per warrant, at the option of the Payee. Since January 2, 2024, the board of directors has elected to extend the liquidation date to April 29, 2024. Accordingly, the Company has drawn down from the Convertible Note and deposited $ 191,667 into the Trust Account in connection with such extension. If the Company is unable to complete the Business Combination before the end of the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem one hundred percent ( 100 %) of the Offering Shares in consideration of a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest not previously released to the Corporation to pay its taxes (less up to $ 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), by (B) the total number of then outstanding Offering Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish rights of the Public Shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Board in accordance with applicable law, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Corporation\u2019s obligations under the MBCA to provide for claims of creditors and other requirements of applicable law. F-8 If the initial shareholders acquire Public Shares, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriter agreed to waive its rights to the deferred underwriting commission (see Note 5) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be only $ 10.15 . In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party (except for the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or Business Combination agreement (a \u201cTarget\u201d), reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $ 10.15 per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.15 per Public Share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or Target that executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company\u2019s indemnity of the underwriter of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. Going Concern Consideration As of December 31, 2023, the Company had de minimis cash and working capital deficit of approximately $ 2.0 million (including tax obligations of approximately $ 885,000 that may be paid using investment income earned in the Trust Account). Further, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans. Prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company\u2019s liquidity needs were satisfied through the payment of $ 25,000 from the Sponsor to purchase Founder Shares (as defined in Note 4) and a loan under the Note (as defined in Note 4) in the amount of approximately $ 145,000 . The Company fully repaid the Note balance on October 4, 2022. The Note was no longer available to the Company after closing of its Initial Public Offering. Subsequent to the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Partial Over-Allotment, the Company\u2019s liquidity needs have been satisfied through the net proceeds from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement held outside of the Trust Account and advances from related parties totaling approximately $ 185,000 as of December 31, 2023. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, the Company borrowed an additional amount of approximately $ 155,000 from related parties and then paid back approximately $ 167,000 , reducing, the total advances amount outstanding to approximately $ 173,000 . In addition, in order to provide the Contribution and to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Company issued the Convertible Note to an affiliate of the Sponsor with a principal amount up to $ 1.75 million on January 2, 2024 as discussed above. From January through March 2024, the Company borrowed $ 191,667 under the Convertible Note and contributed such amount into the Trust Account in connection with extensions to extend the Combination Period to April 29, 2024.

There is no assurance that the Company\u2019s plans to consummate the initial Business Combination will be successful or successful within the Combination Period. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Risks and Uncertainties In February 2022, the Russian Federation and Belarus commenced a military action with the country of Ukraine. As a result of this action, various nations, including the United States, have instituted economic sanctions against the Russian Federation and Belarus. Further, the impact of this action and related sanctions on the world economy is not determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The specific impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is also not determinable as of the date of these financial statements. On October 7, 2023, Hamas militants and members of other terrorist organizations infiltrated Israel\u2019s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of terror attacks on civilian and military targets. The intensity and duration of Israel\u2019s current war against Hamas is difficult to predict, and as are such war\u2019s economic implications on the Company\u2019s business and operations and on Israel\u2019s economy in general. The specific impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is also not determinable as of the date of these financial statements. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the \u201cIR Act\u201d) was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a U.S. federal 1 % excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1 % of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. Any share redemption or other share repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2023, in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax on a redemption of Public Shares or other stock of the Company in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise will depend on a number of factors, including (i) whether the redemption is treated as a repurchase of stock for purposes of the excise tax, (ii) the fair market value of the redemption treated as a repurchase of stock in connection with the Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a Business Combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of a redemption treated as a repurchase of stock) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. As noted above, the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not by the redeeming holder. The imposition of the excise tax could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete a Business Combination or for effecting redemptions and may affect the Company\u2019s ability to complete a Business Combination. On December 27, 2022, the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service issued a Notice 2023-2, which provided interim guidance regarding the application of the corporate stock repurchase excise tax until the issuance of proposed regulations. The Notice excluded the distributions upon complete liquidation of a corporation from the base of the excise tax. The Notice also excludes from the scope of the excise tax any distribution made during the taxable year in which a corporation fully liquidates and dissolves, even if a distribution precedes the formal decision to liquidate. Although such Notice clarifies certain aspects of the excise tax, the interpretation and operation of other aspects of the excise tax remain unclear, and such interim operating rules are subject to change. F-10 Note 2\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Emerging Growth Company The Company is an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company\u2019s financial statements with another public company that is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company had no cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash accounts in a financial institution, which, regularly exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage limit of $ 250,000 . Any loss incurred or a lack of access to such funds could have a significant adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Investments Held in Trust Account The Company\u2019s portfolio of investments is comprised of U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or investments in money market funds that invest in U.S. government securities and generally have a readily determinable fair value, or a combination thereof. When the Company\u2019s investments held in the Trust Account are comprised of U.S. government securities, the investments are classified as trading securities. When the Company\u2019s investments held in the Trust Account are comprised of money market funds, the investments are recognized at fair value. Trading securities and investments in money market funds are presented on the balance sheets at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of these securities are included in interest income from investments held in the Trust Account in the accompanying statements of operations. The estimated fair values of investments held in the Trust Account are determined using available market information. F-11",

            "context": "Each Private Placement Warrant is exercisable for one whole Class A Share at a price of $ 11.50 per share. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants to the Sponsor was added to the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, there will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Private Placement Warrants. Except as set forth below, the Private Placement Warrants will be non-redeemable for cash and exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the Sponsor or their permitted transferees. The Sponsor and the Company\u2019s officers and directors agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of their Private Placement Warrants until 30 days after the completion of the initial Business Combination. Related Party Loans Promissory Note and Advances from Related Parties On March 3, 2022, the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company an aggregate amount of up to $ 200,000 to cover expenses related to the Initial Public Offering pursuant to a promissory note (the \u201cNote\u201d). This loan was non-interest bearing and payable on the date on which the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering. The Company borrowed approximately $ 145,000 under the Note and subsequently fully repaid the Note balance on October 4, 2022. The Note was no longer available to the Company after closing of its Initial Public Offering. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had outstanding advances balance of approximately $ 185,000 and $ 0 , respectively, owed to the Company\u2019s officers for working capital needs, respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, the Company borrowed an additional amount of approximately $ 155,000 from related parties, and then paid back approximately $ 167,000 , reducing the total advances amount outstanding to approximately $ 173,000 . Overfunding Loans Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor extended the Overfunding Loan to the Company in an aggregate amount of $ 900,000 . On October 11, 2022, simultaneously with the sale of the Over-Allotment Units, the Sponsor extended the Additional Overfunding Loan to the Company in an amount of $ 47,850 , for an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $ 947,850 to be deposited in the Trust Account. Upon the closing of the initial Business Combination, the Overfunding Loans will be repaid or converted into shares of Class A Shares at a conversion price of $ 10.00 per share (or a combination of both), at the Sponsor\u2019s discretion. If the Company does not complete an initial Business Combination, it will not repay the Overfunding Loans from amounts held in the Trust Account, and its proceeds will be distributed to the Public Shareholders; however, the Company may repay the Overfunding Loans if there are funds available outside the Trust Account to do so. Convertible Promissory Note In connection with the Contribution and advances the Sponsor may make in the future to the Company for working capital expenses, on January 2, 2024, the Company issued a Convertible Note to an affiliate of the Sponsor with a principal amount up to $ 1.75 million. The Convertible Note bears no interest and is repayable in full upon the earlier of (a) the date of the consummation of the Company\u2019s initial Business Combination, or (b) the date of the Company\u2019s liquidation. If the Company does not consummate an initial Business Combination by the end of the Combination Period, the Convertible Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. Upon the consummation of the Company\u2019s initial Business Combination, the outstanding principal of the Convertible Note may be converted into warrants, at a price of $ 1.00 per warrant, at the option of the New Sponsor. Such warrants will have terms identical to the Private Placement Warrants. F-16 From January through March 2024, the Company borrowed $ 191,667 under the Convertible Note and contributed such amount into the Trust Account in connection with extensions to extend the Combination Period. The option to convert the Convertible Note into warrants qualifies as an embedded derivative under ASC 815 and is required to be recognized at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in the Company\u2019s statements of operations each reporting period until the Convertible Note is repaid or converted. Administrative Services Agreement On October 4, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement pursuant to which it agreed to pay the Sponsor $ 10,000 per month for office space, administrative and support services. Upon completion of a Business Combination or its liquidation, the Company will cease paying these monthly fees. The Company recorded $ 120,000 and $ 30,000 in connection with such fees during the year ended December 31, 2023 and the period from February 15, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022 in the accompanying statements of operations, respectively. The Company prepaid $ 150,000 in connection with such fees and had an unused balance of $ 50,000 in prepaid expenses recorded in the accompanying balance sheets as of December 31, 2022. Such prepaid amount was used up and as of December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an outstanding balance of $ 70,000 in connection with such fees in accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet. The Sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on the Company\u2019s behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable Business Combinations. The Company\u2019s audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to the Sponsor, executive officers or directors, or the Company\u2019s or their affiliates. Note 5\u2014Commitments and Contingencies Registration Rights The holders of Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans and the Contributions (and any shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants or warrants issued upon conversion of the working capital loans and the Contributions and upon conversion of the Founder Shares and the Overfunding Loans), will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration and shareholder rights agreement signed upon the consummation of the Initial Public Offering. These holders will be entitled to certain demand and \u201cpiggyback\u201d registration rights. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Underwriting Agreement The underwriter was entitled to an underwriting discount of $ 0.14 per unit, or approximately $ 0.8 million in the aggregate, paid upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering. An additional fee of $ 0.35 per unit, or $ 2.1 million in the aggregate will be payable to the underwriter for deferred underwriting commissions. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. The underwriter was entitled to an additional fee of approximately $ 45,000 , which was paid upon closing of the Partial Over-Allotment, and approximately $ 112,000 in deferred underwriting commissions in connection with the consummation of the Partial Over-Allotment.
