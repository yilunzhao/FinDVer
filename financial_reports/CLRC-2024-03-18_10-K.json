BUSINESS.\nOverview We are a blank check company formed on December 6, 2021 as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination. We may pursue an initial business combination target in any industry or sector, but we are focused on acquiring a target within the sustainable energy industry in the OECD countries, including climate change, environment, renewable energy and emerging, clean technologies, such as GreenRock. While we are not limited to investing in a company in a specific geographic region, we are focused on the OECD countries and regions with strong policy and regulatory support for the green energy transition. Management believes that this offers considerable, attractive acquisition opportunities given the current OECD ESG principles and the opportunity for growth and financial return.",

After the 26th United Nations Climate Change conference, commonly known as COP26, there has been renewed pressure for both governments and corporations to accelerate their transition to renewable sources in order to meet de-carbonization targets. Reducing carbon emissions, whether through cleaner energy, alternative modes of production, operation, or other means, is paramount for both political and corporate leaders in shaping and achieving their environmental aspirations. Most environmental scenarios assume that to limit global temperatures to less than a 1.5\u00b0C increase in global temperatures in the period 2030-2050 from pre-industrial levels, renewable energy will need to account for least a 60% share of the total global primary energy supply and under the International Energy Agency (\u201cIEA\u201d)\u2019s pathway to net zero target, 90% of global electricity generation in 2050 will need to come from renewable sources, with solar photovoltaic and wind together accounting for nearly 70%. To accomplish this, total annual global investment in clean power and enabling system infrastructure needs to rise from US$380 billion in 2020 to $1.6 trillion by 2030. Given the substantial sums of capital necessary to drive this shift to renewable energy sources, we believe that the public capital markets, supported by project finance lenders, will continue to provide the most efficient pathway for these financing needs.",

Instead, the sponsor has agreed to contribute to us as a loan of $75,000 for each calendar month (commencing on May 2, 2023 and ending on the 1st day of each subsequent month), or portion thereof, that is needed by us to complete an initial business combination from May 2, 2023 until May 2, 2024 (or such earlier date as determined by the board of directors in its sole discretion). Any such loans are non-interest bearing and payable upon the consummation of our initial business combination. If we complete our initial business combination, we will, at the option of our sponsor, repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us or convert a portion or all of the total loan amount into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant, which warrants will be identical to the private placement warrants. If we do not complete a business combination, we will repay such loans only from funds held outside of the trust account. Our sponsor and its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate an initial business combination within such time period, we will redeem 100% of our issued and outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to applicable law and as further described herein, and then seek to liquidate and dissolve. We expect the pro rata redemption price to be approximately $11.06 per Class A ordinary share, without taking into account any interest earned on such funds. However, we cannot assure our shareholders that we will in fact be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public shareholders. We anticipate structuring our initial business combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding share capital, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq\u2019s 80% of net assets test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking shareholder approval, as applicable. Based on the valuation analysis of our management and board of directors, we have determined that the fair market value of GreenRock was substantially in excess of 80% of the funds in the trust account and that the 80% test was therefore satisfied.",

Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us by calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this Report and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as our sponsor and their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors and our sponsor and their affiliates. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder\u2019s fee, consulting fee, advisory fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm\u2019s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder\u2019s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which our sponsor or officers are affiliated, be paid any finder\u2019s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation by the company prior to, or in connection with any services rendered for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). None of our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be allowed to receive any compensation, finder\u2019s fees or consulting fees from a prospective business combination target in connection with a contemplated initial business combination. We have agreed to pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support and to reimburse our sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial business combination. Additionally, the Company entered into the Gluon Letter Agreement with Gluon Partners for consulting services provided to the Company in connection with the identification, evaluation, and analysis of potential business combination transaction targets and related financing transactions. Per Regnarsson, the Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company, is the Managing Partner of Gluon Partners. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination.

Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder\u2019s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders\u2019 ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with an initial business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.

As a result, the shareholder then had an \u201coption window\u201d after the completion of the initial business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company\u2019s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation.

However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination by such time, we may extend the period of time to consummate a business combination.

Our shareholders will also be entitled to vote and redeem their shares in connection with a general meeting held to approve an initial business combination or in a tender offer undertaken in connection with an initial business combination if we propose such a business combination. Pursuant to the terms of our memorandum and articles of association and the trust agreement entered into between us and Continental, in order for the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination to be extended, our sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, would have been required to deposit into the trust account $787,500 ($0.10 per unit, up to an aggregate of $1,575,000) on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for the Paid Extensions. In connection with the 2023 EGM, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association was amended to remove this requirement. Instead, the sponsor has agreed to contribute to us as a loan of $75,000 for each calendar month (commencing on May 2, 2023 and ending on the 1st day of each subsequent month), or portion thereof, that is needed by us to complete an initial business combination from May 2, 2023 until May 2, 2024 (or such earlier date as determined by the board of directors in its sole discretion).

If we do not complete a business combination, we will repay such loans only from funds held outside of the trust account. Our sponsor and its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination.

We expect the pro rata redemption price to be approximately $11.06 per Class A ordinary share, without taking into account any interest earned on such funds.

In January 2019, the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (\u201cAFM\u201d) notified Mr. Ratelband of its intention to impose an order against him for violations committed by WindShareFund N.V., WindShareFund B.V., WindShareFund I B.V., WindShareFund II B.V., Arnhem, and WindShareFund III B.V. (collectively \u201cWSF\u201d) under the Dutch Consumer Protection (Enforcement) Act (\u201cWhc\u201d) regarding the failure of WSF to make certain disclosures to its consumers with respect to the purchase of and investment into wind turbines. The AFM imposed an initial penalty order on or around May 6, 2019, which was replaced and supplemented by a penalty order dated March 12, 2020 (the \u201cMarch 12 AFM Order\u201d). Mr. Ratelband V ultimately appealed the March 12 AFM Order to the Dutch highest court, the College van Beroep voor het bedrijfsleven (\u201cCBb\u201d). On or around November 2, 2021, the CBb issued its order (the \u201cCBb Order\u201d) The CBb Order did not disturb the March 12 AFM Order\u2019s finding that Mr. Ratelband V was the de facto manager of WSF and that (i) Mr. Ratelband V is aware of WSF\u2019s prohibited conduct, (ii) Mr. Ratelband was authorized and reasonably required to prevent and terminate such prohibited conduct, and (iii) Mr. Ratelband omitted measures to this end, consciously accepting the considerable chance that the prohibited behaviors would (continue to) occur. The CBb vacated the March 12 AFM Order\u2019s finding that Mr. Ratelband violated the Whc by failing to disclose the use of WSF funds for personal use. The CBb upheld the March 12 AFM Order\u2019s finding that WSF violated the Whc by failing to disclose accurate information regarding (i) the different proportions of the purchase values and interests acquired in the windmills, (ii) the residual values of the wind turbines, and (iii) the ongoing payment of a management fee. The CBb found that WSF must disclose the accurate information regarding the foregoing. In December 2021, the AFM acknowledged that WSF complied with the CBb order.",
