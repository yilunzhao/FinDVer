Magnetizing water is a process that converts the particles of water, which can naturally appear in various sizes, into evenly sized particles. As a result of this process, we believe that the water increases its hydration and ability to absorb into organic material.

The report of the independent registered public accounting firm includes a going concern uncertainty explanatory paragraph. We have a history of operating losses and negative cash flow in operating activities. We have incurred recurring net losses, including net losses from operations before income taxes of $6.0 million and $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and we had an accumulated deficit of $15.3 million at December 31, 2023. These factors raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern, and our independent registered public accounting firm has included a going concern uncertainty explanatory paragraph in their report for 2023. Our cash needs will depend on numerous factors, including our revenues, completion of our product development activities, customer and market acceptance of our product, and our ability to reduce and control costs. We expect to devote substantial capital resources to, among other things, fund operations and continue development plans. In August 2022, the Company consummated the IPO of 1,440,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $5.00 per share, generating gross proceeds of $7,200,000. Net proceeds from the IPO were approximately $6.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of approximately $998,000. To support our existing and planned business model, the Company needs to raise additional capital to fund our future operations. The Company has not experienced any difficulty in raising funds through loans, and has not experienced any liquidity problems in settling payables in the normal course of business and repaying loans when they fall due. Successful renewal of our loans, however, is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. In addition, the increasingly competitive industry conditions under which we operate may negatively impacted our results of operations and cash flows. Additional debt financing is anticipated to fund the Company\u2019s operations in near future. However, there are no current agreements or understandings with regard to the form, time or amount of such financing and there is no assurance that any of this financing can be obtained or that the Company can continue as a going concern.",

In addition, most of our beverages contain caffeine, the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny, including the suggestion of linkages to a variety of adverse health effects. There is increasing consumer awareness of health risks that are attributed to ingredients we use, particularly in the United States, including increased blood pressure and heart rate, anxiety and insomnia, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products.

The interest rate of the loan is 1.00% per annum and accrues on the unpaid principal balance computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days. Commencing seven months after the effective date of each PPP Loan, the Company is required to pay the Lender equal monthly payments of principal and interest as required to fully amortize any unforgiven principal balance of the loan by the two-year anniversary of the effective date of the loan. The PPP Loan contains customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults, making materially false or misleading representations to the SBA or the Lender, or breaching the terms of the PPP Loan. The occurrence of an event of default may result in the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the PPP Loan, collection of all amounts owing from the Company, or filing suit and obtaining judgment against the Company. Under the terms of the CARES Act, PPP loan recipients can apply for and be granted forgiveness for all or a portion of the loan granted under the PPP. Such forgiveness will be determined, subject to limitations, based on the use of loan proceeds for payment of payroll costs and any payments of mortgage interest, rent, and utilities. Recent modifications to the PPP by the U.S. Treasury and Congress have extended the time period for loan forgiveness beyond the original eight-week period, making it possible for the Company to apply for forgiveness of its PPP loan.
