Business.\nGeneral We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this report as our initial business combination. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, we are a \u201cshell company\u201d as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash. On April 11, 2022, we consummated our initial public offering (the \u201cIPO\u201d) of 8,250,000 units, which included 750,000 units issued pursuant to the partial exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option (the \u201cUnits\u201d), each Unit consisting of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the \u201cpublic shares\u201d) and one redeemable warrant (each, a \u201cPublic Warrant\u201d), each whole Public Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, and the IPO generated gross proceeds of $82,500,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we consummated a private placement (the \u201cPrivate Placement\u201d) with our sponsor, of an aggregate of 510,000 units (the \u201cPrivate Placement Units\u201d) (including 30,000 Private Placement Units purchased pursuant to the partial exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option) at a price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds of $5,100,000. Each Private Placement Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share (the \u201cPrivate Placement Shares\u201d) and one warrant. The terms and provisions of the warrants in the Private Placement Units (the \u201cPrivate Placement Warrants\u201d) are identical to the Public Warrants, except that, subject to certain limited exceptions, they are subject to transfer restrictions until 30 days following the consummation of an initial business combination. On April 11, 2022, a total of $84,150,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement was deposited in a trust account (the \u201cTrust Account\u201d) established for the benefit of the Company\u2019s public shareholders at a U.S. based trust account, with Wilmington Trust, National Association, acting as trustee.",

As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to a traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our Class A ordinary shares (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our Class A ordinary shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost effective method to becoming a public company than a typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.",

Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital, an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders\u2019 interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company\u2019s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.",

There is no assurance that the Company will satisfy the required closing conditions, raise the additional capital it needs to fund its operations, and complete the transaction prior to April 11, 2024 (or July 11, 2024, if certain conditions are met), if at all. The Company also has no approved plan in place to extend the business combination deadline and fund operations for any period of time after April 11, 2024 (or July 11, 2024, if certain conditions are met), in the event that it is unable to complete a business combination by that date.

On April 11, 2022, the Company consummated the IPO of 8,250,000 units (including over-allotment of 750,000 units) (\u201cPublic Units\u201d). Each Public Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, $ 0.0001 par value per share (such shares included in the Public Units, the \u201cPublic Shares\u201d), and one redeemable warrant (the \u201cPublic Warrants\u201d), each whole Public Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Public Share at an exercise price of $ 11.50 per share.

The net proceeds were invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of (i) the completion of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the Company\u2019s shareholders, as described below. Further, on April 12, 2023, the Company issued a press release announcing that it deposited $ 825,000 into the Trust Account, 50 % of this amount being a loan from the Sponsor in the form of a convertible promissory note and other 50 % amount was transferred directly from the remaining cash on hand balance at that time, in order to extend the period of time it has to consummate a business combination by an additional three months, from the then current deadline of April 11, 2023 to July 11, 2023. On July 13, 2023, the Company issued a press release announcing that an aggregate of $ 825,000 has been deposited into the Company\u2019s Trust Account in order to extend the period of time it has to consummate a business combination by an additional three months, from the then current deadline of July 11, 2023 to October 11, 2023. Furthermore, subsequently, on October 11, 2023, the Company issued another press release announcing that the Company\u2019s shareholders extended the date by which the Company must consummate an initial business combination from October 11, 2023 to July 11, 2024 by electing to extend the date to consummate an initial business combination on a monthly basis for up to nine times by an additional one month each time (the \u201cExtension\u201d). The Sponsor (or its affiliates or permitted designees) will deposit into the Trust Account for each such one-month extension the lesser of (a) an aggregate of $ 50,000 or (b) $ 0.03 per public share that remains outstanding and is not redeemed prior to any such one-month extension, unless the closing of the Company\u2019s initial business combination has occurred, and hence, an aggregate of $ 150,000 has been deposited into the Company\u2019s Trust Account through December 31, 2023 in order to extend the period of time it has to consummate a business combination by an additional three months, from the then current deadline of October 11, 2023 to January 11, 2024. Until March 2024, there has been further deposit of an aggregate of $ 150,000 into the Trust Account for extension from January 11, 2024 to April 11, 2024. During the shareholder\u2019s meeting held on October 11, 2023, shareholders holding 3,712,171 public shares (after giving effect to withdrawals of redemptions) exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Company\u2019s Trust Account. As a result, approximately $ 40.5 million (approximately $ 10.92 per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. Following redemptions and through December 31, 2023, the Company had 4,537,829 public shares outstanding. Further, on January 9, 2024, shareholders holding an additional 4,440,202 public shares (after giving effect to withdrawals of redemptions) exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Company\u2019s Trust Account. The funds for the 4,440,202 public shares to be redeemed are currently held in the Trust Account pending the closing of the Business Combination.

The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination (initially anticipated to be $ 10.20 per Public Unit, plus any pro rata interest then in the Trust Account, net of taxes payable). The Public Shares subject to redemption were recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the IPO in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 480, \u201cDistinguishing Liabilities from Equity\u201d (\u201cASC 480\u201d).

However, a greater net tangible asset or cash requirement may be contained in the agreement relating to the Business Combination. In shareholders\u2019 meeting held on October 11, 2023, it was resolved to eliminate this limitation that the Company may not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause the Company\u2019s net tangible assets to be less than $ 5,000,001 (the \u201cRedemption Limitation Amendment\u201d). If the Company is unable to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, including Extension (refer to Note 9), the Company will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay the Company\u2019s franchise and income taxes, if any (less up to $ 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then-issued and outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders\u2019 rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company\u2019s remaining shareholders and its board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company\u2019s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.

The founder shares were granted subject to a performance condition (i.e., the occurrence of a Business Combination). Compensation expense related to the founder shares is recognized only when the performance condition is of probable occurrence under the applicable accounting literature in this circumstance. As of December 31, 2023, the Company determined that a Business Combination is not considered probable until it occurs and, therefore, no stock-based compensation expense has been recognized. Stock-based compensation would be recognized at the date a Business Combination is considered probable (i.e., upon consummation of a Business Combination) in an amount equal to the number of founder shares times the fair value per share at the grant date (unless subsequently modified) less the amount initially received for the purchase of the founder shares.",
