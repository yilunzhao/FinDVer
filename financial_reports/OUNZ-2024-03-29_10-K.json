Business The Trust is an investment trust formed on May 6, 2014 under New York State law pursuant to the Depositary Trust Agreement (\u201cTrust Agreement\u201d), which was amended effective October 26, 2015, to effectuate a name change to Van Eck Merk Gold Trust. The Trust Agreement was further amended on April 28, 2016, to effectuate a second name change to VanEck Merk Gold Trust. The purpose of the Trust is to own gold transferred to the Trust in exchange for shares issued by the Trust (the \u201cShares\u201d). Each Share represents a fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust. Shares are issued by the Trust in blocks of 50,000 called \u201cBaskets\u201d in exchange for gold from certain registered broker-dealers or other securities market participants (\u201cAuthorized Participants\u201d). Baskets may be redeemed by the Trust in exchange for the amount of gold corresponding to their redemption value. The Trust issues and redeems Baskets on an ongoing basis at net asset value to Authorized Participants who have entered into a contract with the Sponsor and the Trustee. The assets of the Trust are anticipated to consist solely of gold bullion. On May 6, 2014, the date the Trust was formed, Virtu Financial (the \u201cInitial Purchaser\u201d) contributed 1,000 Ounces of gold in exchange for 100,000 Shares (or two Baskets). At contribution, the value of the gold deposited with the Trust was based on the price of an Ounce of gold of $1,306.25. The Initial Purchaser is not affiliated with the Sponsor or the Trustee.",

In the case of an investor that purchases Shares for cash, its initial tax basis in its pro rata share of the assets held in the Trust at the time it acquires its Shares will be equal to its cost of acquiring the Shares. In the case of an investor that acquires its Shares as part of the creation of a Basket, the delivery of gold to the Trust in exchange for a pro rata share of the underlying gold the Trust holds at the time it acquires its Shares will not be a taxable event to the investor, and the investor\u2019s tax basis in and holding period for that share of the Trust\u2019s gold will be the same as its tax basis in and holding period for the gold delivered in exchange therefor. For purposes of this discussion, and unless stated otherwise, it is assumed that all of an investor\u2019s Shares are acquired on the same date and at the same price per Share. Investors that hold multiple lots of Shares, or that are contemplating acquiring multiple lots of Shares, should consult their own tax advisers as to the determination of the tax basis in and holding period for the underlying gold represented by such Shares.",

Although it is not entirely free from doubt, the Trust treats the issuance of Shares to the Sponsor as payment of the Sponsor\u2019s Fee and/or reimbursement of the Trust\u2019s expenses and/or liabilities as a taxable exchange by the Trust of the portion of the underlying gold represented by those Shares and thus also constitutes a taxable event for investors.

The Trust is not managed like a corporation or an active investment vehicle. It does not have any officers, directors, or employees and is administered by the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement. The Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and is not required to register under such act. It will not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts, nor is it a commodity pool, or subject to regulation as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading adviser in connection with issuing shares. After consideration of Financial Accounting Standards Topic 946, however, the Sponsor has concluded the Trust meets the fundamental characteristics of an investment company. In addition, while the Trust does not currently possess all of the typical characteristics of an investment company, it believes its activities are consistent with those of an investment company and will therefore apply the guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Topic 946, including disclosure of the financial support contractually required to be provided by an investment company to any of its investees. The Sponsor is responsible for, among other things, overseeing the performance of the Trustee and the Trust\u2019s principal service providers, including the preparation of financial statements.

These inputs are categorized into three broad levels. Level 1 includes unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 includes other significant observable market based inputs (including prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speed, and credit risk). Level 3 includes unobservable inputs, which may include management\u2019s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments. The Trust does not hold any derivative instruments, and its assets only consist of allocated gold bullion and gold receivable; representing gold covered by contractually binding orders for the creation of shares where the gold has not yet been transferred to the Trust\u2019s account and, from time to time, cash, which is used to pay expenses.",

The Trustee determines the NAV of the Trust on each day that NYSE Arca is open for regular trading, as promptly as practical after 4:00 PM New York time.

ORGANIZATION The VanEck Merk Gold Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d; known as the Merk Gold Trust prior to October 26, 2015 and then as the Van Eck Merk Gold Trust prior to April 28, 2016) is an investment trust formed on May 6, 2014 under New York law pursuant to a depositary trust agreement. After consideration of Financial Accounting Standards Topic 946, Merk Investments LLC (the \u201cSponsor\u201d) has concluded the Trust meets the fundamental characteristics of an investment company. In addition, while the Trust does not currently possess all of the typical characteristics of an investment company, it believes its activities are consistent with those of an investment company and will therefore apply the guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Topic 946, including disclosure of the financial support contractually required to be provided by an investment company to any of its investees. The Sponsor is responsible for, among other things, overseeing the performance of The Bank of New York Mellon (the \u201cTrustee\u201d) and the Trust\u2019s principal service providers, including the preparation of financial statements.

Level 3 includes unobservable inputs, which may include management\u2019s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments. The Trust does not hold any derivative instruments, and its assets only consist of allocated gold bullion and gold receivable; representing gold covered by contractually binding orders for the creation of shares where the gold has not yet been transferred to the Trust\u2019s account and, from time to time, cash, which is used to pay expenses.",

Several factors could affect the price of gold: (i) global gold supply and demand, which is influenced by such factors as forward selling by gold producers, purchases made by gold producers to unwind gold hedge positions, central bank purchases and sales, and production and cost levels in major gold-producing countries; (ii) investors\u2019 expectations with respect to the rate of inflation; (iii) currency exchange rates; (iv) interest rates; (v) investment and trading activities of hedge funds and commodity funds; and (vi) global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations. In addition, there is no assurance that gold will maintain its long-term value in terms of purchasing power in the future. In the event that the price of gold declines, the Sponsor expects the value of an investment in the shares to decline proportionately. Each of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Trust\u2019s financial position and results of operations.",
