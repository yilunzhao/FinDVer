With our disruptive next-generation robotics technology, we are seeking to increase the efficiency of surgical procedures, improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Led by a visionary team of engineers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, we intend to deliver the next generation in robotic-assisted surgery, designed to solve the shortcomings of open surgery, and current laparoscopic and robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery. We have developed multiple prototypes, have had pre-submission meetings with the FDA to align on our regulatory strategy, and plan to file a de novo application with the FDA for use in ventral hernia procedures as our first indication.",

By fundamentally engineering a better solution, we believe we have created a more capable surgical robot than those currently available on the market, and if authorized by the FDA, the Vicarious Surgical System will offer surgeons the ability to perform surgical procedures with greater dexterity and greater access to the entire abdomen, with better visibility and sensor-based feedback, through a small single incision in the abdomen. The Vicarious Surgical System features proprietary \u201cde-coupled\u201d actuators, which are intended to enable a cascade of benefits, including improved robotic mobility, reduced size, improved functionality and lower materials costs. If authorized by the FDA, the Vicarious Surgical System is designed to enable surgeons to perform procedures inside the abdomen with human-equivalent motion, with a full nine degrees of freedom per robotic arm, providing an experience that is more natural, and more akin to the surgeon\u2019s own upper body movements. In surgical procedures conducted on cadavers, the Vicarious Surgical System provides exceptional reach within the abdomen, and if authorized by the FDA, it will enable the surgeon to enter the abdomen from nearly any angle and work in nearly any direction, without having to triangulate to the surgical area from multiple incisions or to operate only within the limited area directly in front of a single incision. The Vicarious Surgical System is designed to provide exceptional visualization, with a high-performance, stereoscopic camera that rotates in three degrees of freedom (yaw, pitch, and roll) to provide the surgeon with stereoscopic imaging of nearly every surface in the abdomen. The Vicarious Surgical System also contains 28 sensors per instrument arm, which allows the system to provide real-time feedback to the surgeon on force, motion and other data that are intended to enhance surgical procedures and patient outcomes.",

Unlike the large footprints of legacy surgical robotic systems that require a construction build-out and a dedicated operating room, the Vicarious Surgical System is mobile and much smaller and could be easily moved to any operating room throughout a medical facility. We anticipate that, if authorized by the FDA, the smaller size and advanced engineering of the Vicarious Surgical System and related disposable instruments will be offered at a cost-effective price point compared to existing legacy robotic systems. Hospitals and ASCs would not be required to dedicate permanent space and would reduce expenses relating to sterilization and operating room turnover. We believe that, if authorized by the FDA, adoption of the Vicarious Surgical System could be facilitated by a streamlined training regimen, where surgeons will be able to develop proficiency much more quickly than for legacy robotic systems. This is due to the design features of the Vicarious Surgical System, such as the ease of use and more natural, human-equivalent motion of the Vicarious Surgical System, the reduced surgeon burden during setup, and the fact that the Vicarious Surgical System would not be confined to a dedicated operating suite and therefore could have more availability for training purposes. In addition, with its increased capability and dexterity, the Vicarious Surgical System is designed to enable many procedures to be performed faster and more effectively, with less injury and risk to the patient, significantly reducing overall healthcare costs. Because the Vicarious Surgical System has not yet been authorized by the FDA or commercialized, the intended advantages of the Vicarious Surgical System have not yet been realized and are dependent upon the successful development of the Vicarious Surgical System and a timely authorization by the FDA.",

The large incisions required for open surgery, while allowing the surgeon to see with their own eyes and operate with their own hands, create significant trauma to the patient, resulting in long hospitalization and recovery times, high hospitalization costs, as well as significant pain and suffering. Due to the significant trauma to the patient associated with open surgery, 15% to 20% of such surgeries result in tissue or internal organs pushing through the muscle into the abdomen, or incisional hernias, caused by the operation, requiring additional complex surgery to correct. Although there have been significant improvements in minimally invasive surgery procedures over open surgery, the following limitations associated with minimally invasive surgery still exist:",

Feedback provided by the FDA indicated that each robotic-assisted surgical system has distinctive kinetics, connections, data transmission and interfaces, including interfaces for the user, patient and environment, the combination of which composes a unique and multifaceted system. Additionally, the FDA indicated that each robotic-assisted surgical system has unique inputs and outputs and must account for uncertainty and instability in different ways. Taken together, these different technological characteristics raise different questions of safety or effectiveness that are not applicable to a predicate device and may pose a significant safety or effectiveness concern for the Vicarious Surgical System. For example, the way that a robotic-assisted surgical system is constructed and implemented will have a direct bearing on the safety and effectiveness profile of the device and different robotic-assisted surgical systems are not sufficiently similar to allow for meaningful comparison between the Vicarious Surgical System and predicate robotic-assisted surgical systems. The FDA indicated that the evaluation of the complex Vicarious Surgical System requires a holistic approach of the performance testing, such as software, bench, animal, human factors and usability, and clinical data to determine how each element establishes the Vicarious Surgical System\u2019s integration approach to the intended use and more specifically the indicated procedures. Therefore, each robotic-assisted surgical system carries new or different risks and an evaluation of these risks will require an independent evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of the Vicarious Surgical System due to the technology and the implementation into the clinical care. Based on this feedback, the FDA has determined that a 510(k) submission would likely be found not substantially equivalent to a predicate robotic-assisted surgical system.

Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFDCA\u201d), a medical device is defined as \u201can instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component, part or accessory which is, among other things: intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals; or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes.\u201d This definition provides a clear distinction between a medical device and other FDA regulated products such as drugs. If the primary intended use of a medical product is achieved through chemical action or by being metabolized by the body, the product is usually a drug or biologic.

Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes \u2014 Class I, Class II or Class III \u2014 depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Classification of a device is important because the class to which a device is assigned determines, among other things, the necessity and type of FDA review required prior to marketing the device. Class I devices are those for which reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness can be maintained through adherence to general controls that include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation (\u201cQSR\u201d), as well as regulations requiring establishment registration and device listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. The Class I designation also applies to devices for which there is insufficient information to determine that general controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device or to establish special controls to provide such assurance, but that are not life-supporting or life-sustaining or for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, and that do not present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury.",

While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, most Class II devices require a clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification prior to commercialization in the United States; however, the FDA has the authority to exempt Class II devices from the premarket notification requirement under certain circumstances. As a result, manufacturers of most Class II devices must submit 510(k) premarket notifications to the FDA in order to obtain the necessary clearance to market or commercially distribute such devices. To obtain 510(k) clearance, manufacturers must submit to the FDA adequate information demonstrating that the proposed device is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to a \u201cpredicate device\u201d that is already on the market. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to PMA, meaning, (i) a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (\u201cpreamendments device\u201d) and for which a PMA is not required, (ii) a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or (iii) a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process.

Such devices generally require FDA approval through the PMA process, unless the device is a preamendments device not yet subject to a regulation requiring premarket approval. The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) process. For a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate through extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and one or more clinical trials, that the device is safe and effective for its proposed indication. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA submission, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review and determine whether the proposed device can be approved for commercialization, although in practice, PMA reviews often take significantly longer, and it can take up to several years for the FDA to issue a final decision.

On March 2, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review this case and allocated one hour for oral arguments, which occurred on November 10, 2020. On February 10, 2021, the Department of Justice sent a letter to the U.S. Supreme Court that stated the new administration believes the individual mandate and its tax penalty are constitutional, and if the Court determines that they are not, the provision can be severed from the remainder of the act. With this letter, the Biden administration reversed the Trump administration position that was presented to the Court. The Trump administration had claimed that the tax provision is unconstitutional and could not be separated from the ACA, making the entire ACA unconstitutional as a result. The U.S. Supreme Court held in a 7\u20132 opinion that the states and individuals that brought the lawsuit challenging the ACA\u2019s individual mandate do not have standing to challenge the law. The U.S. Supreme Court did not reach the merits of the challenge, but the decision ends the case. It is unclear how potential litigation and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will affect the implementation of that law, the pharmaceutical and medical device industries more generally, and our business.

These laws overlap and apply simultaneously with federal privacy and security requirements and regulated entities must comply with all of them. The California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) went into effect January 1, 2020, and is one of the most restrictive state privacy laws, protecting a wide variety of personal information and granting significant rights to California residents with respect to their personal information. Regulations under CCPA have been modified several times, and continue to be modified. Additionally, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act, (\u201cCPRA\u201d) was approved by California voters in the election of November 3, 2020 and went into effect in January of 2023. The CPRA modified the CCPA significantly, and may result in further uncertainty, additional costs and expenses stemming from efforts to comply with this law, and increases the potential for harm and liability for failure to comply. Among other things, the CPRA established a new regulatory authority, the California Privacy Protection Agency, which is enacting new regulations and has expanded enforcement authority. Other states in the U.S. are considering privacy laws similar to CCPA. Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas Virginia, and Utah have enacted similar data protection laws to California and other U.S. states have proposals under consideration, increasing our regulatory compliance risk.

Our information technology systems, and those of our vendors and partners, are potentially vulnerable to disruption due to breakdown, malicious intrusion and computer viruses or other disruptive events, including, but not limited to, natural disasters and catastrophes. Cyberattacks and other malicious internet-based activity continue to increase, and cloud-based platform providers of services have been and are expected to continue to be targeted, especially in the health care industry. Methods of attacks on information technology systems and data security breaches change frequently, are increasingly complex and sophisticated, including deployment of harmful malware and key loggers, ransomware, a malicious website, social engineering and phishing scams, and other means to affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our technology systems and data, and can originate from a wide variety of sources. In addition to traditional computer \u201chackers,\u201d malicious code, such as viruses and worms, denial-of-service attacks and sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors present a constant threat, including advanced persistent threat intrusions. Cyberattacks may also be due to employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate in preventing or responding to any of these circumstances. Techniques used in cybersecurity attacks to obtain unauthorized access, disable or sabotage information technology systems are evolving rapidly with data breaches and other cybersecurity incidents becoming commonplace. We recognize the risk of cybersecurity incidents and work to constantly evolve our incident response plans as the known threat vectors emerge. We vet and verify the cybersecurity practices and compliance of our vendors to ensure they follow established guidelines, compliance requirements, and best practices related to their industry. Internally, we utilize a cybersecurity maturity model based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, standards to track and report on the current and future compliance and progress within the multiple areas of compliance and concern. We intend to make steady measured improvements to our cybersecurity maturity along with investments in tools, and services that are aligned with our growth and maturity. We intend to adhere to a baseline of best practices that include proper use of encryption of data and communications, policies and procedures, and mitigation/validation practices that seek to ensure the approach is meeting or exceeding our commitment to our plan.

As of December 31, 2023, we had federal net operating loss carry forwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) to offset future taxable income of approximately $128.8 million, of which approximately $2.8 million will expire at various dates from 2034 through 2037, if not utilized. A lack of future taxable income would adversely affect our ability to utilize these NOLs. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset post-change taxable income. For these purposes, an ownership change generally occurs where the equity ownership of one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who owns at least 5% of a corporation\u2019s stock increases its ownership by more than 50 percentage points over its lowest ownership percentage within a three-year period (calculated on a rolling basis). Our existing NOLs may be subject to limitations arising out of previous ownership changes and we may be limited as to the amount that can be utilized each year as a result of such previous ownership changes. In addition, future changes in our stock ownership, including future offerings, as well as other changes that may be outside of our control, could result in additional ownership changes under Section 382 of the Code. Our NOLs may also be impaired under similar provisions of state law. We have not conducted a study to assess whether an ownership change has occurred, whether there have been multiple ownership changes since inception or whether there has been an ownership change as the result of the Business Combination due to the significant complexity and costs associated with such a study.

In particular, in December of 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the individual mandate was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, effective January 1, 2019. In December 2019, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the district court\u2019s ruling that the individual mandate in the ACA was unconstitutional, but remanded the case to the district court to determine whether other reforms enacted as part of the ACA, but not specifically related to the individual mandate or health insurance could be severed from the rest of the ACA so as not to have the law declared invalid in its entirety. On March 2, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review this case and allocated one hour for oral arguments, which occurred on November 10, 2020. On February 10, 2021, the Department of Justice sent a letter to the U.S. Supreme Court that stated the new administration believes the individual mandate and its tax penalty are constitutional, and if the Court determines that they are not, the provision can be severed from the remainder of the act. With this letter, the Biden administration reversed the Trump administration position that was presented to the Court. The Trump administration had claimed that the tax provision is unconstitutional and could not be separated from the ACA, making the entire ACA unconstitutional as a result. The U.S. Supreme Court held in a 7\u20132 opinion that the states and individuals that brought the lawsuit challenging the ACA\u2019s individual mandate do not have standing to challenge the law. The U.S. Supreme Court did not reach the merits of the challenge, but the decision ends the case. It is unclear how potential litigation and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will affect the implementation of that law, the pharmaceutical and medical device industries more generally, and our business. Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax. In addition, CMS published a final rule that would give states greater flexibility, effective January 1, 2020, in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.

In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement, or failure to claim patent eligible subject matter. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with the prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement during prosecution either in the U.S. or abroad. Third parties may also raise similar claims before the USPTO or foreign patent offices, even outside the context of litigation.

We do not expect to generate revenue unless and until we receive FDA authorization of our product candidate. The amount of revenue, if any, from initial sales of a new product is difficult to predict and, even if we successfully commercialize our product candidate upon approval and begin generating revenue, such revenues will initially only modestly reduce our continued net losses resulting from our research and development and marketing activities which we expect to continue to increase even after market authorization is received.",

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nBackground and Remediation of Material Weakness In connection with our evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures covering our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We have concluded that material weaknesses exist in our disclosure controls and procedures, including internal control over financial reporting, as we do not have the necessary business processes, personnel and related internal controls to operate in a manner to satisfy the accounting and financial reporting requirements of a public company. These material weaknesses manifested themselves in ways that included the improper segregation of duties relating to review of the recording of journal entries and the reconciliation of key accounts and safeguarding of assets, as well as the analysis of accounting for certain transactions and accounts, improper controls related to information technology, ineffective risk assessment process and documentation and monitoring of control processes, accounting policies and procedures.",
