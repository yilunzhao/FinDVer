The Federal Reserve Board regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the returns earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect the net interest margin. The resultant changes in interest rates can also materially affect the value of certain financial assets we hold, such as debt securities. For example, in 2023, the Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee increased the target fed funds rate by 100 basis points resulting in the Bank's net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis increasing from 3.77% to 4.40% comprised of a 206 basis point increase in earning asset yields and a 190 basis point increase in total cost of interest-bearing liabilities. At the same time, accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased from $358.7 million in 2022 to $309.8 million in 2023, driven by an increase in the valuation of available-for-sale securities. The policies of the Federal Reserve Board can adversely affect borrowers, and increase default risk on their loans.
