Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the \u201cCommon Stock\u201d), and one redeemable warrant (the \u201cWarrant\u201d) entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, and one right (\u201cRight\u201d) to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of Common Stock upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $100,000,000.

The code of ethics codifies the business and ethical principles that govern all aspects of our business.\nConflicts of Interest\nInvestors should be aware of the following potential conflicts of interest:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general, officers and directors of a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware are required to present business opportunities to a corporation if:\n\n\n Accordingly, as a result of multiple business affiliations, our officers and directors may have similar legal obligations relating to presenting business opportunities meeting the above-listed criteria to multiple entities. Furthermore, our certificate of incorporation provides that the doctrine of corporate opportunity will not apply with respect to any of our officers or directors in circumstances where the application of the doctrine would conflict with any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations they may have. In order to minimize potential conflicts of interest which may arise from multiple affiliations, our officers and directors (other than our independent directors) have agreed to present to us for our consideration, prior to presentation to any other person or entity, any suitable opportunity to acquire a target business, until the earlier of: (1) our consummation of an initial business combination and (2) 12 months (or up to 15 months, as applicable) from the closing of IPO. This agreement is, however, subject to any pre-existing fiduciary and contractual obligations such officer or director may from time to time have to another entity. Accordingly, if any of them becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. We do not believe, however, that the pre-existing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers and directors will materially undermine our ability to complete our business combination because in most cases the affiliated companies are closely held entities controlled by the officer or director or the nature of the affiliated company\u2019s business is such that it is unlikely that a conflict will arise.",

As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company is a Special Purpose Acquisition Corporation that was formed for the purpose of completing a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities on or before August 22, 2024 There is no assurance that the Company will obtain the necessary approvals or raise the additional capital it needs to fund its business operations and complete any business combination prior to August 22, 2024, if at all. The Company also has no approved plan in place to extend the business combination deadline beyond August 22, 2024 and lacks the capital resources needed to fund operations and complete any business combination, even if the deadline to complete a business combination is extended to a later date. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Management\u2019s plans with regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.",

The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the \u201cTreasury\u201d) has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. The IR Act applies only to repurchases that occur after December 31, 2022.",

Simultaneously with the closing of the over-allotment option, the Company consummated the sale of an additional aggregate of 30,000 Private Units with the Sponsor at a price of $ 10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $ 300,000 . Each Private Unit will consist of one share of common stock (\u201cPrivate Share\u201d), one right (\u201cPrivate Right\u201d) and one redeemable warrant (\u201cPrivate Warrant\u201d). Each whole Private Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $ 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment.

The proceeds from the Private Units were added to the proceeds from the IPO to be held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the sale of the Private Units will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law), and the Private Units and all underlying securities will expire worthless.",

The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. After consideration of all of the information available, management believes that significant uncertainty exists with respect to future realization of the deferred tax assets and has therefore established a full valuation allowance.
