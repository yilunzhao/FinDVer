Our Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 9,400,000 warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant ($9,400,000 in the aggregate) each exercisable to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, in a private placement that closed simultaneously with the closing of our IPO on November 16, 2021. These warrants are referenced herein as the private placement warrants (the \u201cPrivate Placement Warrants\u201d). Our initial stockholders, which include our Sponsor, and our anchor investors own an aggregate of 5,750,000 shares of our Class B common stock, which will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock at the time of our initial business combination. In addition, each of (i) Castle Creek Strategies LLC, Context Partners Master Fund, L.P., D. E. Shaw Valence Portfolios, L.L.C., Meteora Capital Partners, LP, HGC Investment Management Inc., Highbridge Capital Management, LLC, Radcliffe Capital Management, L.P., and Polar Asset Management Partners Inc., purchased 9.40% of the units offered in the IPO, excluding the shares sold pursuant to the underwriters\u2019 exercise of the over-allotment option, (ii) Sandia Investment Management L.P. and Space Summit Capital LLC each purchased 7.50% of the units offered in the IPO, excluding the shares sold pursuant to the underwriters\u2019 exercise of the over-allotment option, and (iii) Vestcor, Inc. and certain accounts managed by Eagle Point Credit Management LLC each purchased 4.90% of the units offered in the IPO, excluding the shares sold pursuant to the underwriters\u2019 exercise of the over-allotment option, or in each case funds affiliated with such investors, together the anchor investors, for an aggregate purchase price of no more than $200 million, at the public offering price of the units. The anchor investors as a group purchased 20,000,000 units in the aggregate in our IPO, which was approximately 86.96% of the units issued in the IPO, including the shares sold pursuant to the underwriters\u2019 exercise of the over-allotment option. Based on the amounts purchased at the time of our IPO, not all of the anchor investors were required to file Schedule 13Gs to report their beneficial ownership, so we do not know if all of the anchor investors continue to hold all of the shares they purchased in the IPO. Based on Schedule 13Gs filed by the Sponsor and certain of the anchor investors, as of the dates reflected in such Schedule 13Gs (see Item 12, Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters, below), our Sponsor and the anchor investors continued to hold (in the aggregate) at least approximately 55% of our outstanding shares of common stock. We issued to the anchor investors 1,515,160 shares of our Class B common stock in connection with the closing of the IPO, and our Sponsor cancelled a like number of shares. Accordingly, because the anchor investors purchased the full amount of units in which they expressed an interest, the anchor investors owned an aggregate of approximately 74.84% of the outstanding shares of common stock immediately following the IPO and our Sponsor owned approximately 14.73% of the outstanding shares of common stock following immediately following the IPO. Because the anchor investors purchased all of the units that were allocated to them, substantially all of the units purchased in the IPO were held by the anchor investors and these investors potentially have different interests than our other public stockholders, as further discussed in this Form 10-K. The anchor investors will also have the potential to realize enhanced economic returns and overall economic outcome from their investment in us in comparison to our other public stockholders who did not make anchor investments and purchase founder shares. Because the anchor investors purchased all of the units that are allocated to them, the anchor investors\u2019 purchases significantly reduced the available public float for our securities. Such reduction in our available public float may consequently reduce the trading volume, volatility, and liquidity of our securities relative to what they would have been had such units been purchased by public investors and adversely impact our ability to get our securities listed on Nasdaq or another stock exchange. Our IPO prospectus and our charter at the time of the IPO provided that we had 12 months from the date of our IPO (until November 16, 2022) to complete a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (as later extended, the \u201cCombination Period\u201d). At the time of the IPO, our charter and Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated November 11, 2021, by and between us and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (now Equiniti) (the \u201cTrust Agreement\u201d), provided that we had the right to extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination up to two times by an additional three months each time (for a total of up to 18 months to complete a Business Combination) by depositing into the trust account maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (now Equiniti), acting as trustee, an amount of $0.10 per unit sold to the public in the IPO for each such three-month extension, as described in more detail in our IPO prospectus. The first such extension election was used in November 2022 to extend the Combination Period to February 15, 2023 by depositing $2,300,000 into the Company\u2019s trust account. 5",

If the Board decided to implement an extension, the Sponsor or its designees agreed to contribute to us loans of $0.05 for each public share that was not redeemed plus such amount for each calendar month (commencing on February 16, 2023 and ending on the 15th day of each subsequent month), or portion thereof, that is needed by the Company to complete the Business Combination until August 15, 2023. Each of the five additional extensions was implemented. In an annual meeting of our stockholders on August 8, 2023, an additional extension amendment proposal (the \u201cSecond Extension Amendment Proposal\u201d) was approved, and as a result, we extended the Combination Period to September 15, 2023 and granted the Company the right to extend the Combination Period on a monthly basis up to five (5) times by an additional one (1) month each time after September 15, 2023 or later extended deadline date, by resolution of the Board if requested by the Sponsor.

In a special meeting of our stockholders on February 12, 2024, an extension amendment proposal (the \u201cThird Extension Amendment Proposal\u201d) was approved and we extended the Combination Period to March 15, 2024 and granted the Company the right to extend the Combination Period on a monthly basis up to eight (8) times by an additional one (1) month each time after March 15, 2024 or later extended deadline date, by resolution of the Board if requested by the Sponsor. If the Board decided to implement an extension, the Sponsor or its designees agreed to contribute to us loans of $50,000 plus such amount for each calendar month (commencing on March 16, 2024 and ending on the 15th day of each subsequent month), or portion thereof, that is needed by the Company to complete the Business Combination until November 15, 2024. The purpose of the extension right is to provide the Company more time to complete a Business Combination, which the Board believes is in the best interests of our stockholders. The first such additional monthly extension to April 15, 2024 was implemented. On April 10, 2024, we issued a press release indicating the Company\u2019s intent to extend the time available in order to consummate a business combination from April 15, 2024 to May 15, 2024. On March 13, 2023, the Sponsor loaned the Company $692,204 in order to extend the Combination Period to April 15, 2023; on April 13, 2023, the Sponsor loaned the Company up to $4,153,224 in connection with the extension of the period by which to consummate an initial business combination; and on August 16, 2023, the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company up to $8,400,000 in connection with the extension of the period by which to consummate an initial business combination. In connection with the First Extension Amendment Proposal, Second Extension Amendment Proposal and the Third Extension Amendment Proposal, certain stockholders who owned shares of our common stock issued in our IPO (we refer to such stockholders as \u201cpublic stockholders\u201d and such shares as \u201cpublic shares\u201d) elected to redeem all or a portion of their public shares. For stockholders who elected to redeem, the redemption for a per-share price, payable in cash, was equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Company\u2019s trust account, including interest (which interest was net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. As a result, in connection with the First Extension Amendment Proposal, 9,155,918 shares were redeemed at $10.32 per share, totaling $94,489,075. In connection with the Second Extension Amendment Proposal, 7,354,836 shares were redeemed at $10.83 per share, totaling $79,652,874. In connection with the Third Extension Amendment Proposal, 4,573,860 shares were redeemed at $11.00 per share, totaling $50,312,460.

Bulk commodities include grains and vegetable oils, mineral and metallic ores and concentrates, energy fuels, biofuels, cement and aggregates, and other goods and commodities essential to modern economies. We believe that this vertical integration will enable synergies and economies of scale and leverage the inherent energy efficiency and low carbon emissions of freight trains, and the rapidly growing demand for bulk commodities necessary to transform industrialized economies into energy efficient and green economies, and to transform emerging economies into industrialized economies.

Acquisition Strategy Our business strategy is to target, identify, and complete a business combination with one or more companies that produces bulk commodities and/or transports bulk commodities. We place particular focus on identifying businesses and business combinations that integrate natural resources and transportation services. We believe that integration of bulk commodity production and transportation presents an attractive opportunity to pursue a business combination with a blank check company. We believe this business combination will enable us to leverage the production expertise and resource assets of bulk commodity producers, and the transportation assets and efficiency expertise of transportation providers. We believe our integrated approach will create production-to-destination cost efficiencies, market access opportunities, and pricing opportunities unavailable to stand-alone bulk commodity producers and transportation service providers. Transportation cost is a major component of the delivered cost of bulk commodities. We believe our expertise in solving transportation problems will enable the bulk commodity producers we target to enter new markets, unlock their resource assets, increase the value of their resource assets, and ultimately achieve higher market share, revenue, and netbacks, Similarly, we believe our integrated approach will enable the transportation service providers we target to make operational and infrastructure efficiency improvements that will achieve long-term market share, revenue, and profitability improvements. We believe integration of production and transportation will result in a business combination that provides the transportation company with long-term access to bulk commodities, the resource company with long-term transportation cost efficiency, and the integrated company with market share, pricing power, profitability, and growth opportunities that are not inaccessible to non-integrated producers and transportation providers competing for the same end users of the bulk commodities. 8",

If we vertically integrate this market, we believe it will allow us to lock in the value of the complete commodity supply chain, achieve market leverage, and provide commodity consumers with guaranteed sourcing and logistics solutions.

We believe certain producers of bulk commodities, such as grains and vegetable oils, mineral and metallic ores and concentrates, energy fuels, biofuels, cement and aggregates, and other goods and commodities essential to modern economies, are undervalued for one or more of the following reasons: the producer\u2019s lack of cost-effective transport to market, the difficult and lengthy regulatory process to permit and license new production and transportation assets, and the market not appreciating the limited supply of the producer\u2019s bulk commodities or the increase in demand for bulk commodities that we believe will occur in the developing world as it seeks to modernize. We believe most market analysis unduly discounts the potential for development and demand for commodities among the 82 percent of the world\u2019s population that lives in countries classified by the United Nations as Medium or Low Human Development. |\n| \u2022 | Emissions Profiles that Enable Governments to Meet Carbon Emission Reduction Goals. Railroads emit 1.5 to 5 times less greenhouse gas emissions than trucks, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. We believe demand for railroad services, and railroad pricing power, will increase substantially as North American governments either institute carbon taxation schemes, carbon emissions reduction schemes, or make direct investment into freight and passenger railroad infrastructure in order to reduce reliance on trucks and privately owned internal-combustion engine vehicles. We also believe demand for certain fossil fuels will grow during transition to zero-net carbon emissions infrastructure and transportation, because they offer significantly reduced carbon and other deleterious emissions per unit of transportation output or heating output, compared to existing sources. In particular, we believe demand for natural gas and crude oils with low- or near-zero sulfur and metals content will supplant or eliminate coal and crude oils with high sulfur and metals content in world markets. |\n| \u2022 | Control of Commodity Assets or Transportation Services for Commodity Producers with Exceptional Growth Potential. Demand for bulk commodities including copper, nickel, lithium, rare earths, and other metals and non-metallic minerals essential to electric vehicles, electrical power generation, and electrical power transmission is expected to grow at least 5-fold by 2050, according to the World Bank, and as much as 10 fold according to industry news sources including mining.com. We believe that demand growth will include pricing power both for commodity producers as well as transportation providers, particularly because railroad transportation of bulk commodities is not readily replaced by truck, and because we believe regulatory constraints on pipeline construction and replacement will become increasingly onerous. |\n| \u2022 | Significant Barriers to Entry. We are targeting businesses or assets where new entrants are constrained by lengthy, complicated, or expensive barriers to entry, such as environmental clearances and permits, linear right-of-way acquisition, public lands entry, or market dominance regulations. In particular, railroads cannot readily be replicated, expansion into new markets is difficult and onerous for large railroad companies, and permitting of resource extraction on federal, tribal, or state lands is lengthy and complex. |",

Our IPO prospectus and the charter in effect at the time of the IPO provided that we had 12 months from the date of our IPO (until November 16, 2022) to complete a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (the \u201cCombination Period\u201d). At the time of our IPO, our charter and Trust Agreement provided that we had the right to extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination up to two times by an additional three months each time (for a total of up to 18 months to complete a Business Combination) by depositing into the trust account maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company (now Equiniti), acting as trustee, an amount of $0.10 per unit sold to the public in the IPO for each such three-month extension, as described in more detail in our IPO prospectus. The first such extension Election was used in November 2022 to extend the Combination Period to February 15, 2023 by depositing $2,300,000 into the Company\u2019s trust account. In a special meeting of the stockholders on February 8, 2023, the First Extension Amendment Proposal and a trust amendment proposal were approved, and as a result, we extended the Combination Period to March 15, 2023 and granted the Company the right to extend the Combination Period on a monthly basis up to five (5) times by an additional one (1) month each time after March 15, 2023 or later extended deadline date, by resolution of the Board if requested by the Sponsor. If the Board decided to implement an extension, the Sponsor or its designees agreed to contribute to us loans of $0.05 for each public share that was not redeemed plus such amount for each calendar month (commencing on February 16, 2023 and ending on the 15th day of each subsequent month), or portion thereof, that was needed by the Company to complete the Business Combination until August 15, 2023. Each of the five additional extensions was implemented. In an annual meeting of our stockholders on August 8, 2023, the Second Extension Amendment Proposal was approved, and as a result, we extended the Combination Period to September 15, 2023 and granted the Company the right to extend the Combination Period on a monthly basis up to five (5) times by an additional one (1) month each time after September 15, 2023 or later extended deadline date, by resolution of the Board if requested by the Sponsor. If the Board decided to implement an extension, the Sponsor or its designees agreed to contribute to us loans of $140,000 plus such amount for each calendar month (commencing on September 16, 2023 and ending on the 15th day of each subsequent month), or portion thereof, that was needed by the Company to complete the Business Combination until February 15, 2024. Each of the five additional extensions was implemented. In a special meeting of our stockholders on February 12, 2024, the Third Extension Amendment Proposal was approved, and as a result, we extended the Combination Period to March 15, 2024 and granted the Company the right to extend the Combination Period on a monthly basis up to eight (8) times by an additional one (1) month each time after March 15, 2024 or later extended deadline date, by resolution of the Board if requested by the Sponsor. If the Board decided to implement an extension, the Sponsor or its designees agreed to contribute to us loans of $50,000 plus such amount for each calendar month (commencing on March 16, 2024 and ending on the 15th day of each subsequent month), or portion thereof, that is needed by the Company to complete the Business Combination until November 15, 2024. The purpose of the monthly extensions is to provide the Company more time to complete a Business Combination, which the Board believes is in the best interests of our stockholders. On March 13, 2023, the Sponsor loaned the Company $692,204 in order to extend the Combination Period to April 15, 2023; on April 13, 2023, the Sponsor loaned the Company up to $4,153,224 in connection with the extension of the period by which to consummate an initial business combination; and on August 16, 2023, the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company up to $8,400,000 in connection with the extension of the period by which to consummate an initial business combination, in accordance with the terms of the applicable promissory note. In connection with the First Extension Amendment Proposal, Second Extension Amendment Proposal and Third Extension Amendment Proposal, certain stockholders who owned shares of our common stock issued in our IPO (we refer to such stockholders as \u201cpublic stockholders\u201d and such shares as \u201cpublic shares\u201d) elected to redeem all or a portion of their public shares. For Stockholders who elected to redeem, the redemption for a per-share price, payable in cash, was equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Company\u2019s trust account, including interest (which interest was net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares.

Therefore, as of February 12, 2024, there were 1,915,386 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, issued and outstanding. As of April 1, 2024, $23,333,336 was available in the trust account. We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would consummate such financing only simultaneously with the consummation of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law or the rules of any exchange on which our securities are listed at the time of a business combination, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. Members of our management team directly or indirectly own a portion of our founders shares, common stock and/or Private Placement Warrants and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors were to be included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. Sources of Target Businesses Target business candidates may be brought to our attention from various sources, including unaffiliated sources such as investment bankers and investment professionals. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us by calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read the final prospectus relating to our IPO (Registration Statement on Form S-1, File No. 333-256381 (the \u201cRegistration Statement\u201d)) as filed with the SEC on November 12, 2021, as well as subsequent reports later filed by us with the SEC, and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as our Sponsor and its affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we may receive proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors and our Sponsor and their respective industry and business contacts as well as their affiliates. We may engage professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions, in which event we may pay a finder\u2019s fee, consulting fee, advisory fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm\u2019s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. Payment of finder\u2019s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will our Sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which our Sponsor or officers are affiliated, be paid any finder\u2019s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation by the company prior to, or in connection with any services rendered for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). Although none of our Sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be allowed to receive any compensation, finder\u2019s fees or consulting fees from a prospective business combination target in connection with a contemplated initial business combination, we do not have a policy that prohibits our Sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, from negotiating for the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses by a target business. We have agreed to pay our Sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support and to reimburse our Sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial business combination. During 2022, our Sponsor waived 2 months, or $20,000, of administrative fees, and in 2023 our Sponsor waived 7 months, or $70,000, of administrative fees. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements is not being used as a criterion in our selection process of an initial business combination candidate. 12",

In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with an initial business combination target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or from another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. Potential target companies with whom we may engage in discussions may have had prior discussions with other blank check companies, bankers in the industry and/or other professional advisors including blank check companies with which our executive officers or board of directors were affiliated. We may pursue transactions with such potential targets (i) if such other blank check companies are no longer pursuing transactions with such potential targets, (ii) if we become aware that such potential targets are interested in a potential initial business combination with us and (iii) if we believe such transactions would be attractive to our stockholders. As more fully discussed in the section of this Form 10-K titled \u201cConflicts of Interest,\u201d if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an initial business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination On March 11, 2024, we received notice from the NYSE that it had commenced delisting of our securities and on March 26, 2023 our securities were delisted from the NYSE. Effective as of March 12, 2024, our securities may be quoted and traded in the over-the-counter (OTC Pink) market. We intend to seek a listing of our securities on the Nasdaq Stock Market prior to or in connection with the consummation of any business combination we may seek to consummate. The Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of our initial business combination will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation, a valuation based on trading multiples of comparable public businesses or a valuation based on the financial metrics of M&A transactions of comparable businesses. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Our board of directors may not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target\u2019s assets or prospects. We will not purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. We anticipate structuring our initial business combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders. However, we will only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act rules and regulations. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on 13",

            "context": "valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the Nasdaq\u2019s 80% fair market value test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable. To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure our stockholders that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. Competition In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, there is competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses is limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights have reduced and may continue to reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. Management Operating and Investment Experience We believe that our executive officers possess the experience, skills and contacts necessary to source, evaluate, and execute an attractive business combination. See the section titled \u201cOur Management Team\u201d for complete information on the experience of our officers and directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers and directors are not required to commit their full time to our affairs and can allocate their time to other businesses. Each of our employees to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business (which could range from only a few hours a week while we are trying to locate a potential target business to a majority of their time as we move into serious negotiations with a target business for a business combination). The past successes of our executive officers and directors do not guarantee that we will successfully consummate an initial business combination. As more fully discussed in \u201cSources of Target Businesses,\u201d if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Delaware law, prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Most of our officers and directors currently have certain pre-existing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations. 14",

As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are taking advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the closing of our IPO on November 16, 2021 (i.e., November 16, 2026), (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to emerging growth company will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act. Additionally, we are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30th, or (2) our annual revenues exceed $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30. Employees We currently have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they each devote as much of their time as they each deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will each devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination. Periodic Reporting and Financial Information Our units, shares, and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public auditors. You can read our SEC filings over the internet at the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov or on the Company\u2019s website at http://irr-x.com/. We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, U.S. GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 15",

As a result, in addition to our initial stockholders\u2019 founder shares, we would need none of the 1,915,386 shares of Class A common stock sold after November 16, 2021 to be voted in favor of an initial business combination (assuming all outstanding shares are voted and our Sponsor, officers and directors do not purchase any public shares) in order to have our initial business combination approved. Our Sponsor, officers, directors, and anchor investors own all of the shares of the Class B common stock, which represented 20% of our outstanding shares of common stock immediately following the November 16, 2021 closing and the private placement and represents approximately 55% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of April 1, 2024 as a result of redemptions in relation to our February 2024 and earlier stockholder meeting. Accordingly, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, the agreement by our initial stockholders to vote in favor of our initial business combination, and the agreement by the anchor investors to vote any founder shares held by them, will increase the likelihood that we will receive the requisite stockholder approval for such initial business combination. Because the anchor investors purchased all of the units that they expressed an interest in purchasing, if they hold all such units until prior to consummation of our initial business combination and vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination, then in addition to the founder shares, no affirmative votes from other public stockholders would be required to approve our initial business combination. The anchor investors are not required to vote any of their public shares in favor of our initial business combination or for or against any other matter presented for a stockholder vote. Because the anchor investors purchased all of the units for which they expressed an interest, the substantial majority of units sold are held by the anchor investors. The anchor investors may have different interests than our other public stockholders since their investments in the founder shares will generally be worthless if we do not consummate an initial business combination within the completion window. Because the anchor investors can purchase founder shares for the same nominal purchase price paid for such shares by our Sponsor, the anchor investors will also have the potential to realize enhanced economic returns from their investment in us in comparison to our other public stockholders who are not purchasing founder shares from our Sponsor. Accordingly, the anchor investors may be more likely to favor any proposed initial business combination transaction even if our other public stockholders do not favor the transaction. Participation by our anchor investors reduced the public float for our shares. Twelve anchor investors each purchased up to either 1,880,000, 1,500,000, or 980,000 units in our IPO at the offering price. Because each of the anchor investors purchased all of the units for which they expressed an interest, approximately 86.96% of the units sold in the IPO (including the shares sold pursuant to the underwriters\u2019 exercise of the over-allotment option) were purchased by the anchor investors immediately following IPO, and such purchases have reduced the available public float for our securities. Such reduction in our available public float may consequently reduce the trading volume, volatility and liquidity of our securities relative to what they would have been had such units been purchased by public investors and could adversely impact our ability to get our securities listed on Nasdaq or other stock exchange. The anchor investors are not required to hold any units, Class A common stock or warrants they purchased in the IPO or thereafter for any amount of time. Accordingly, the anchor investors may sell any, or up to all, of the units, Class A common stock or warrants they purchased in the IPO or thereafter at any time. The sale of material amounts of units, Class A common stock or warrants, or the perception that such sales may occur, could reduce the market prices of those securities and may encourage short sales. Based on the amounts purchased at the time of our IPO, not all of the anchor investors were required to file Schedule 13Gs to report their beneficial ownership, so we do not know if all of the anchor investors continue to hold all of the shares they purchased in the IPO. Based on Schedule 13Gs filed by the Sponsor and certain of the anchor investors, as of the dates reflected in such Schedule 13Gs (see Item 12, Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters, below), our Sponsor and the anchor investors continued to hold (in the aggregate) approximately 55% of our outstanding shares of common stock. 17",

At the time of their investment in us, the stockholders are not provided with an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of our initial business combination. Since our board of directors may complete an initial business combination without seeking stockholder approval, public stockholders may not have the right or opportunity to vote on the initial business combination, unless we seek such stockholder vote. Accordingly, if we do not seek stockholder approval, the stockholders\u2019 only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to exercising their redemption rights within the period of time (which will be at least 20 business days) set forth in our tender offer documents mailed to our public stockholders in which we describe our initial business combination. The ability of our public stockholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into an initial business combination with a target. We may seek to enter into an initial business combination agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights, we would not be able to meet such closing condition and, as a result, would not be able to proceed with the initial business combination. Furthermore, in no event will we redeem our public shares unless our net tangible assets are at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters\u2019 fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 or such greater amount necessary to satisfy a closing condition, each as described above, we would not proceed with such redemption and the related business combination and may instead search for an alternate business combination. Prospective targets will be aware of these risks and, thus, may be reluctant to enter into an initial business combination with us. The ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure. At the time we enter into an agreement for our initial business combination, we will not know how many stockholders may exercise their redemption rights, and therefore will need to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption. If our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the trust account to meet such requirements, or arrange for third party financing. In addition, if a larger number of shares are submitted for redemption than we initially expected, we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the trust account or arrange for third party financing. Raising additional third party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. Furthermore, this dilution would increase to the extent that the anti-dilution provision of the Class B common stock results in the issuance of Class A shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the Class B common stock at the time of our business combination. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete the most desirable business combination available to us or optimize our capital structure. The amount of the deferred underwriting commissions payable to the underwriters will not be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed in connection with an initial business combination. The per-share amount we will distribute to stockholders who properly exercise their redemption rights will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commission and after such redemptions, the per-share value of shares held by non-redeeming stockholders will reflect our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting commissions. 18",

            "context": "The ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares could increase the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful and that our stockholders would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem their stock. If our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful is increased. If our initial business combination is unsuccessful, the stockholders would not receive their pro rata portion of the trust account until we liquidate the trust account. If the stockholders are in need of immediate liquidity, the stockholders could attempt to sell their stock in the open market; however, at such time our stock may trade at a discount to the pro rata amount per share in the trust account. In either situation, the stockholders may suffer a material loss on their investment or lose the benefit of funds expected in connection with our redemption until we liquidate or the stockholders are able to sell their stock in the open market. The requirement that we complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame described in our certificate of incorporation may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating an initial business combination and may decrease our ability to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our initial business combination on terms that would produce value for our stockholders. Any potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning an initial business combination will be aware that we must complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame for the Combination Period, as described in more detail in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and which Combination Period is currently April 15, 2024 (but on April 10, 2024 we issued a press release indicating that we intend to extend the time period to May 15, 2024 and the period may be further extended until up to November 15, 2024, as further described in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Consequently, such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating an initial business combination, knowing that if we do not complete our initial business combination with that particular target business, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination with any target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the timeframe described above. In addition, we may have limited time to conduct due diligence and may enter into our initial business combination on terms that we would have rejected upon a more comprehensive investigation. If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors and their affiliates may elect to purchase shares or warrants from public stockholders, which may influence a vote on a proposed initial business combination and reduce the public \u201cfloat\u201d of our Class A common stock. If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants or a combination thereof in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination, although they are under no obligation to do so. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. The purpose of such purchases could be to vote such shares in favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination, or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. 19",

If a stockholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with our initial business combination, or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed. We will comply with the tender offer rules or proxy rules, as applicable, when conducting redemptions in connection with our initial business combination. Despite our compliance with these rules, if a stockholder fails to receive our tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, such stockholder may not become aware of the opportunity to redeem its shares. In addition, proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will describe the various procedures that must be complied with in order to validly tender or redeem public shares. For example, we may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically. In the event that a stockholder fails to comply with these or any other procedures, its shares may not be redeemed. Our stockholders will not have any rights or interests in funds from the trust account, except under certain limited circumstances. For the stockholders to liquidate their investment, therefore, they may be forced to sell their public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss. Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business combination, and then only in connection with those shares of Class A common stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described herein, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame set forth in our certificate of incorporation or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders\u2019 rights or pre-initial business combination activity and (iii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete an initial business combination within the prescribed time frame, subject to applicable law and as further described herein. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind in the trust account. Holders of warrants will not have any right to the proceeds held in the trust account with respect to the warrants. Accordingly, to liquidate their investment, our stockholders may be forced to sell their public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss. Our stockholders are not entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies. Since the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants are intended to be used to complete an initial business combination with a target business that has not been identified, we may be deemed to be a \u201cblank check\u201d company under the United States securities laws. However, because we have net tangible assets in excess of $5,000,000 and will file a Current Report on Form 8-K, including an audited balance sheet demonstrating this fact, we are exempt from rules promulgated by the SEC to protect investors in blank check companies, such as Rule 419. Accordingly, investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules. Among other things, this means our units are tradable and we will have a longer period of time to complete our initial business combination than do companies subject to Rule 419. Moreover, if we were subject to Rule 419, that rule would prohibit the release of any interest earned on funds held in the trust account to us unless and until the funds in the trust account were released to us in connection with our completion of an initial business combination. Because of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $11.01 per share, as of December 31, 2023, on our redemption of our public shares, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, and our warrants will expire worthless. 20",

            "context": "There is competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess similar technical, human and other resources to ours, and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable are limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, because we are obligated to pay cash for the shares of Class A common stock which our public stockholders redeem in connection with our initial business combination, target companies will be aware that this may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination. This may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.10 per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. In certain circumstances, our public stockholders may receive less than $10.10 per share upon our liquidation. See \u201c- If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than the $10.10 per share initially placed in the trust account or the current value per share currently held in the trust account as of April 1, 2024\u201d and other risk factors below. The net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants not being held in the trust account have been utilized. We depend on loans from our Sponsor or management team to fund our search for an initial business combination and to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to continue obtaining these loans, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination. Of the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, only approximately $1,750,000 was available to us initially outside the trust account to fund our working capital requirements. Because our offering expenses exceeded our estimate of $750,000, we have funded such excess with funds not to be held in the trust account. The amount held in the trust account has not been impacted as a result of such increase or decrease. None of our Sponsor, members of our management team nor any of their affiliates or any of the anchor investors are under any obligation to advance additional funds to us. Any advances may be repaid only from funds held outside the trust account or from funds released to us upon completion of our initial business combination. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into private placement-equivalent warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our Sponsor or any affiliates of our Sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. If we are unable to obtain additional loans, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. Consequently, our public stockholders may only receive the current value per share as of April 1, 2024 on our redemption of our public shares, and our warrants will expire worthless. In certain circumstances, our public stockholders may receive less than $10.10 per share on the redemption of their shares. See \u201c- If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than the $10.10 per share initially placed in the trust account, or the the current value per share currently held in the trust account as of April 1, 2024\u201d and other risk factors below.

Our placing of funds in the trust account may not protect those funds from third-party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if they execute such agreements they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account.

Marcum LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, and the underwriters of the offering, will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by public stockholders could be less than the $10.10 per share initially placed in the trust account or the current value per share currently held in the trust account as of April 1, 2024, due to claims of such creditors. Pursuant to the letter agreement, the form of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Registration Statement, our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our Sponsor\u2019s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, it is unlikely that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. Our directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our Sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public stockholders. In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per share and (ii) the actual amount per share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment and subject to their fiduciary duties may choose not to do so in any particular instance if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public stockholders may be reduced below approximately $11.01 per share, as of December 31, 2023. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy indemnification claims of our directors and executive officers. We have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law. However, our officers and directors have agreed to waive (and any other persons who may become an officer or director prior to the initial business combination will also be required to waive) any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the trust account and not to seek recourse against the trust account for any reason whatsoever.

Our obligation to indemnify our officers and directors may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our officers or directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against our officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders. Furthermore, a stockholder\u2019s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against our officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions. If, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds, and we and our board may be exposed to claims of punitive damages. If, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a \u201cpreferential transfer\u201d or a \u201cfraudulent conveyance.\u201d As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. If, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of our stockholders and the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced. If, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced. Our stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares. Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame set forth in our certificate of incorporation may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If a corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder\u2019s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. However, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the end of the period of time to consummate a business combination (which is currently up to November 15, 2024, if extended through such date) in the event we do not complete our initial business combination and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with the foregoing procedures. Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the 10 years following our dissolution. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. If our plan of distribution complies with Section 281(b) of the DGCL, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder\u2019s pro rata 23",

We cannot assure our stockholders that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend beyond the third anniversary of such date. Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame set forth in our certificate of incorporation is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders until after the consummation of our initial business combination, which could delay the opportunity for our stockholders to elect directors. Under Section 211(b) of the DGCL, we are, required to hold an annual meeting of stockholders for the purposes of electing directors in accordance with our bylaws unless such election is made by written consent in lieu of such a meeting. We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, and thus we may not be in compliance with Section 211(b) of the DGCL or the rules of any stock exchange on which our securities are listed, which require an annual meeting. Therefore, if our stockholders want us to hold an annual meeting prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, they may attempt to force us to hold one by submitting an application to the Delaware Court of Chancery in accordance with Section 211(c) of the DGCL. Because we are neither limited to evaluating a target business in a particular industry sector nor have we selected any specific target businesses with which to pursue our initial business combination, our stockholders will be unable to ascertain the merits or risks of any particular target business\u2019s operations. We are not limited to completing an initial business combination in any industry or geographical region, although we are not, under our certificate of incorporation, permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations. Because we have not yet definitively selected any specific target business with respect to a business combination, there is no basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any particular target business\u2019s operations, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition or prospects. To the extent we complete our initial business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations with which we combine. For example, if we combine with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings, we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or a development stage entity. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure our stockholders that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors or that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. We also cannot assure our stockholders that an investment in our securities will ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if such opportunity were available, in a business combination target. Accordingly, any stockholders who choose to remain stockholders following our initial business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such stockholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission. We may seek business combination opportunities in industries or sectors which may or may not be outside of our management\u2019s area of expertise. Although we focus on identifying companies in sectors where we have experience, we may consider an initial business combination outside of our management\u2019s area of expertise if an initial business combination candidate is presented to us and we determine that such candidate offers an attractive business combination opportunity for our company or we are unable to identify a suitable candidate in this sector after having expanded a reasonable amount of 24",

We also cannot assure our stockholders that an investment in our securities will not ultimately prove to be less favorable to investors in the market than a direct investment, if an opportunity were available, in an initial business combination candidate. In the event we elect to pursue a business combination outside of the areas of our management\u2019s expertise, our management\u2019s expertise may not be directly applicable to its evaluation or operation, and the information contained in this Form 10-K regarding the areas of our management\u2019s expertise would not be relevant to an understanding of the business that we elect to acquire. As a result, our management may not be able to adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. Accordingly, any stockholders who choose to remain stockholders following our initial business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares. Such stockholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value. Although we have general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses, we may enter into our initial business combination with a target that does not meet such criteria and guidelines, and as a result, the target business with which we enter into our initial business combination may not have attributes entirely consistent with our general criteria and guidelines. Although we have general criteria and guidelines for evaluating prospective target businesses, it is possible that a target business with which we enter into our initial business combination will not have all of these positive attributes. If we complete our initial business combination with a target that does not meet some or all of these guidelines, such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a business that does meet all of our general criteria and guidelines. In addition, if we announce a prospective business combination with a target that does not meet our general criteria and guidelines, a greater number of stockholders may exercise their redemption rights, which may make it difficult for us to meet any closing condition with a target business that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. In addition, if stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, it may be more difficult for us to attain stockholder approval of our initial business combination if the target business does not meet our general criteria and guidelines. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only current value per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. In certain circumstances, our public stockholders may receive less than $11.01 per share as of December 31, 2023, on the redemption of their shares. See \u201c- If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than the $10.10 per share initially placed in the trust account or the current value per share currently held in the trust account as of April 1, 2024\u201d and other risk factors below. We may seek business combination opportunities with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of revenue, cash flow or earnings, which could subject us to volatile revenues, cash flows or earnings or difficulty in retaining key personnel. To the extent we complete our initial business combination with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of revenues or earnings, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the operations of the business with which we combine. These risks include volatile revenues or earnings and difficulties in obtaining and retaining key personnel. We may not be able to properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors and we may not have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. We are not required to obtain a fairness opinion, and consequently, our stockholders may have no assurance from an independent source that the price we are paying for the business is fair to our company from a financial point of view. Unless we complete our initial business combination with an affiliated entity or our board cannot independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or from another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that the price we are paying is fair to our company from a financial point of view. If no opinion is obtained, our stockholders will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors, who will determine fair market value based on standards generally accepted by the financial community. Such standards used will be disclosed in our proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, related to our initial business combination. 25",

            "context": "Because we must furnish our stockholders with target business financial statements, we may lose the ability to complete an otherwise advantageous initial business combination with some prospective target businesses. The federal proxy rules require that a proxy statement with respect to a vote on an initial business combination meeting certain financial significance tests include historical and/or pro forma financial statement disclosure in periodic reports. We will include the same financial statement disclosure in connection with our tender offer documents, whether or not they are required under the tender offer rules. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, or international financial reporting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such financial statements in time for us to disclose such financial statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. Compliance obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may make it more difficult for us to effectuate our initial business combination, require substantial financial and management resources, and increase the time and costs of completing an initial business combination. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2023. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. Further, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. The fact that we are a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome on us as compared to other public companies because a target company with which we seek to complete our initial business combination may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of the internal control of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination. Concentration of ownership among our Sponsor and the anchor investors may prevent other investors from influencing significant corporate decisions or adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Our Sponsor and the anchor investors owned collectively 89.57% of our outstanding shares of common stock immediately following our IPO. Based on the amounts purchased at the time of our IPO, not all of the anchor investors were required to file Schedule 13Gs to report their beneficial ownership, so we do not know if all of the anchor investors continue to hold all of the shares they purchased in the IPO. Based on Schedule 13Gs filed by the Sponsor and certain of the anchor investors, as of the dates reflected in such Schedule 13Gs (see Item 12, Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters, below), our Sponsor and the anchor investors continued to hold (in the aggregate) approximately 55% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, these stockholders have substantial control over us and could be able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval (although we have no knowledge of any affiliation or other agreement or arrangement, as to voting of our securities or otherwise, among any such persons). For example, in the event that the anchor investors continue to hold the shares included in the units they purchased in the IPO and vote such shares in favor of our initial business combination (although they are not contractually obligated to, their interest in our founder shares directly or in the Sponsor may provide an incentive for them to do so), we would not need any additional public shares sold to be voted in favor of our initial business combination to have our initial business combination approved. This potential concentration of influence could be disadvantageous to other stockholders with interests different from those of our Sponsor and the anchor investors. In addition, this potential significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common shares because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with principal stockholders and might make it more difficult to complete a business combination with targets that would prefer to enter into a transaction with a SPAC with less concentrated ownership. 26",

            "context": "Since our anchor investors own founder shares, a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular target business is appropriate for our initial business combination. The anchor investors paid only a nominal amount for the founder shares that they own. The anchor investors will benefit from any appreciation in the value of the founder shares above that nominal amount, provided that we successfully complete a business combination. Moreover, because the anchor investors acquired all of the their units in the IPO for a purchase price of $10.00 per unit, and acquired all of the 1,515,160 founder shares for a price of $0.004 per share, then assuming each warrant has no value and without taking into account any liquidity discount on the founder shares, the anchor investors paid an effective price of $9.29 per share of common stock acquired, as compared to the $10.00 per share paid by the other public stockholders in the IPO. As a result of their interest in the founder shares, the anchor investors may have an incentive to vote any public shares they own in favor of a business combination, and, if a business combination is approved, they may make a substantial profit on such interests, even if the business combination is with a target that ultimately declines in value and is not profitable for other public stockholders. We do not have a specified maximum redemption threshold. The absence of such a redemption threshold may make it possible for us to complete an initial business combination with which a substantial majority of our stockholders do not agree. Our certificate of incorporation does not provide a specified maximum redemption threshold, except that in no event will we redeem our public shares unless our net tangible assets are at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters\u2019 fees and commissions (such that we are not subject to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. As a result, we may be able to complete our initial business combination even though a substantial majority of our public stockholders do not agree with the transaction and have redeemed their shares or, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, have entered into privately negotiated agreements to sell their shares to our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed initial business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial business combination or redeem any shares, all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination. In order to effectuate an initial business combination, we and other blank check companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and other governing instruments, including their warrant agreements. We cannot assure our stockholders that we will not seek to further amend our certificate of incorporation or governing instruments in a manner that will make it easier for us to complete our initial business combination that our stockholders may not support. In order to effectuate an initial business combination, we and other blank check companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and modified governing instruments, including their warrant agreements. For example, on February 12, 2024, an amendment to our certificate of incorporation (the \u201cThird Extension Amendment Proposal\u201d) was approved by our stockholders, and as a result, we extended the Combination Period through March 15, 2024 and the Company was granted the right to extend the Combination Period on a monthly basis up to eight (8) times by an additional one (1) month each time until November 15, 2024. As another example, blank check companies have amended the definition of business combination, increased redemption thresholds and extended the time to consummate an initial business combination and, with respect to their warrants, amended their warrant agreements to require the warrants to be exchanged for cash and/or other securities. To the extent we seek to amend our organizational documents in a way that would be deemed to fundamentally change the nature of any of our securities issued in the IPO, we would register, or seek an exemption from registration for, the affected securities. We cannot assure our stockholders that we will not seek to amend our certificate of incorporation or governing instruments or extend the time to consummate an initial business combination in order to effectuate our initial business combination. The provisions of our certificate of incorporation that relate to our pre-business combination activity (and corresponding provisions of the agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account), may be amended with the approval of holders of 65% of our common stock, which is a lower amendment threshold than that of some other blank check companies. It may be easier for us, therefore, to amend our certificate of incorporation and the Trust Agreement to facilitate the completion of an initial business combination that some of our stockholders may not support. 27",

In all other instances, our certificate of incorporation may be amended by holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock entitled to vote thereon, subject to applicable provisions of the DGCL or applicable stock exchange rules. We may not issue additional securities that can vote on amendments to our certificate of incorporation. Holders of our founder shares, who collectively beneficially own up to approximately 55% of our common stock after the redemption relating to our February 12, 2024 stockholder meeting, will participate in any vote to amend our certificate of incorporation and/or Trust Agreement and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. Because the anchor investors purchased all of the units that they have expressed an interest in purchasing in the IPO, if such anchor investors hold all such units until prior to consummation of our initial business combination and vote their public shares to amend our certificate of incorporation, no affirmative votes from other public stockholders may be required to approve such amendment to our certificate of incorporation. As a result, we may be able to amend the provisions of our certificate of incorporation which govern our pre-initial business combination behavior more easily than some other blank check companies, and this may increase our ability to complete an initial business combination with which our stockholders do not agree. Our stockholders may pursue remedies against us for any breach of our certificate of incorporation. Our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our certificate of incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares on a business combination if we do not complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders\u2019 rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. These agreements are contained in a letter agreement that we have entered into with our Sponsor, officers and directors. Our stockholders are not parties to, or third-party beneficiaries of, these agreements and, as a result, will not have the ability to pursue remedies against our Sponsor, officers or directors for any breach of these agreements. As a result, in the event of a breach, our stockholders would need to pursue a stockholder derivative action, subject to applicable law. We may be unable to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination or to fund the operations and growth of a target business, which could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular business combination. We may target businesses larger than we could acquire with the amount remaining in the trust account. As a result, we may be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial business combination. We cannot assure our stockholders that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to complete our initial business combination, we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. Further, the amount of additional financing we may be required to obtain could increase as a result of future growth capital needs for any particular transaction, the depletion of the available net proceeds in search of a target business, the obligation to repurchase for cash a significant number of shares from stockholders who elect redemption in connection with our initial business combination and/or the terms of negotiated transactions to purchase shares in connection with our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only current value or less per share plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.

Furthermore, as described in the risk factor entitled \u201cIf third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than the $10.10 per share initially placed in the trust account or the current value per share currently held in the trust account as of April 1, 2024,\u201d under certain circumstances our public stockholders may receive less than the current value per share upon the liquidation of the trust account. Our initial stockholders and anchor investors control the election of our board of directors until consummation of our initial business combination and will hold a substantial interest in us. As a result, they will elect all of our directors prior to our initial business combination and may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that our stockholders do not support. Immediately after the closing of our IPO on November 16, 2021, our initial stockholders and the anchor investors owned shares representing 89.57% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Based on the amounts purchased at the time of our IPO, not all of the anchor investors were required to file Schedule 13Gs to report their beneficial ownership, so we do not know if all of the anchor investors continue to hold all of the shares they purchased in the IPO. Based on Schedule 13Gs filed by the Sponsor and certain of the anchor investors, as of the dates reflected in such Schedule 13Gs (see Item 12, Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters, below), our Sponsor and the anchor investors continued to hold (in the aggregate) at least approximately 55% of our outstanding shares of common stock. In addition, the founder shares, all of which are held by our initial stockholders and the anchor investors, will entitle the holders to elect all of our directors prior to our initial business combination. Holders of our public shares will have no right to vote on the election or removal of directors during such time. As a result, our stockholders will not have any influence over the election or removal of directors prior to our initial business combination. Accordingly, our initial stockholders and the anchor investors may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that our stockholders do not support, including amendments to our certificate of incorporation and approval of major corporate transactions. The anchor investors each purchased all of the units that each anchor investor has expressed an interest in purchasing, increasing their control. Factors that would be considered in making such additional purchases would include consideration of the current trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, our board of directors, whose members were elected by our initial stockholders, is and will be divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior to the completion of our initial business combination, in which case all of the current directors will continue in office until at least the completion of the initial business combination. If there is an annual meeting, as a consequence of our \u201cstaggered\u201d board of directors, only a minority of the board of directors will be considered for election and our initial stockholders and the anchor investors, because of their ownership position, will have considerable influence regarding the outcome. Accordingly, our initial stockholders and the anchor investors will continue to exert control at least until the completion of our initial business combination. Resources could be wasted in researching business combinations that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only the current value per share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. We anticipate that the investigation of each specific target business and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys, consultants and others. If we decide not to complete a specific initial business combination, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, if we reach an agreement relating to a specific target business, we may fail to complete our initial business combination for any number of reasons including those beyond our control. Any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only the current value per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.

These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation or reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses, if any, following our initial business combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous. Our key personnel may be able to remain with the company after the completion of our initial business combination only if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the initial business combination. Additionally, they may negotiate reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred on our behalf prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, should they choose to do so. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the initial business combination and could provide for such individuals to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to us after the completion of the initial business combination, or as reimbursement for such out-of-pocket expenses. The personal and financial interests of such individuals may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business. However, we believe the ability of such individuals to remain with us after the completion of our initial business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. There is no certainty, however, that any of our key personnel will remain with us after the completion of our initial business combination. We cannot assure our stockholders that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with us.

When evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with a prospective target business, our ability to assess the target business\u2019s management may be limited due to a lack of time, resources or information. Our assessment of the capabilities of the target\u2019s management, therefore, may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities we suspected. Should the target\u2019s management not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to manage a public company, the operations and profitability of the post-combination business may be negatively impacted. Accordingly, any stockholders who choose to remain stockholders following the initial business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares. Such stockholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value. As the number of special purpose acquisition companies evaluating targets increases, attractive targets may become scarcer and there may be more competition for attractive targets. This could increase the cost of our initial business combination and could even result in our inability to find a target or to consummate an initial business combination. In recent years, the number of special purpose acquisition companies that have been formed has increased substantially. Many potential targets for special purpose acquisition companies have already entered into an initial business combination, and there are still many special purpose acquisition companies seeking targets for their initial business combination, as well as many such companies currently in registration. As a result, at times, fewer attractive targets may be available, and it may require more time, more effort and more resources to identify a suitable target and to consummate an initial business combination. In addition, because there are more special purpose acquisition companies seeking to enter into an initial business combination with available targets, the competition for available targets with attractive fundamentals or business models may increase, which could cause targets companies to demand improved financial terms.

On December 27, 2022, the Internal Revenue Service published Notice 2023-2, providing \u201cInitial Guidance\u201d regarding the application of the Excise Tax on repurchases of corporate stock under Section 4501. Under these authorities we expect the Excise Tax to be imposed on the fair market value of stock repurchased by us. Under a \u201cnetting rule\u201d, the fair market value of stock repurchased by us may be reduced by the fair market value of securities issued by us in the same taxable year, with the 1% Excise Tax then imposed on the excess, if any, of the value of redemptions over the value of issuances. Therefore, issuances of stock by us in connection with our initial business combination transaction (including any PIPE transaction at the time of our initial business combination) will reduce the amount of the Excise Tax in connection with redemptions occurring in the same taxable year. However, a business combination may not be completed during 2024 and, even if a business combination is completed, the fair market value of the securities redeemed may exceed the fair market value of the securities issued in such a combination or otherwise. (The fair market value of securities that are redeemed is determined by the market price of the stock on the day of redemption, regardless of the actual redemption amount.) Consequently, the Excise Tax may make a transaction with us less appealing to potential business combination targets. Further, while the authorities indicate that as a general rule the Excise Tax does not apply in the event of a complete liquidation of a covered corporation, the availability of this exemption under circumstances that might surround the liquidation of a SPAC is not entirely clear. While excise tax returns are generally filed on a quarterly basis, the Internal Revenue Service expects to issue regulations providing that reports of Excise Tax liability are due with the first quarterly excise tax return filed after the close of the taxable year. Unlike some other blank check companies, we may extend the time to complete a business combination by a one month extension each time without a stockholder vote or their ability to redeem their shares. Unlike some other blank check companies, we may, but we are not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, by a one month extension each time, up to November 15, 2024, to complete a business combination pursuant to the extensions as further described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K without a stockholder vote or their ability to redeem their shares. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within the applicable time period, we will promptly redeem the public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account and promptly following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. We are dependent upon our executive officers and directors and their departure could adversely affect our ability to operate. Our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of individuals and, in particular, our executive officers and directors. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our executive officers and directors, at least until we have completed our initial business combination. We do not have an employment agreement with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any of our directors or executive officers. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our directors or executive officers could have a detrimental effect on us. Since our Sponsor, officers and directors, and the anchor investors will lose their entire investment in us if our initial business combination is not completed (other than with respect to any public shares they acquired), and because our Sponsor, officers and directors and the anchor investors who have an interest in founder shares may profit substantially even under circumstances where our public stockholders would experience losses in connection with their investment, a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business combination. In addition, since our Sponsor paid only approximately $0.004 per share for the founder shares, certain of our officers and directors and the anchor investors could potentially make a substantial profit even if we acquire a target business that subsequently declines in value. In March 2021, our Sponsor paid us $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share, to cover certain of our formation and operating expenses in consideration for 7,906,250 founder shares. In September 2021, our Sponsor forfeited 2,156,250 founder shares, resulting in our Sponsor holding 5,750,000 founder shares, for which it paid approximately $0.004 per share on a post-forfeiture basis.

Additionally, each of the anchor investors entered into an agreement with our Sponsor and certain of its members pursuant to which, subject to the conditions set forth therein, each such investor purchased up to either 142,425, 113,637, or 74,243, depending on such investors percentage investment, founder shares upon closing of our IPO on November 16, 2021. Our Sponsor accordingly cancelled an aggregate of 1,515,160 founder shares, which were reissued by us to our anchor investors in the IPO. As a result of the founder shares that our anchor investors may hold, they may have different interests with respect to a vote on an initial business combination than other public stockholders. In addition, our Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 9,400,000 Private Placement Warrants, each exercisable for one share of our Class A common stock at $11.50 per share, for a purchase price of $9,400,000, or $1.00 per warrant, that will also be worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination. Holders of founder shares have agreed (A) to vote any shares owned by them in favor of any proposed initial business combination and (B) not to redeem any founder shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination. In addition, we may obtain loans from our Sponsor, affiliates of our Sponsor or an officer or director. The personal and financial interests of our officers and directors may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business combination, completing an initial business combination and influencing the operation of the business following the initial business combination. Our officers and directors will allocate their time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs. This conflict of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our officers and directors are not required to, and will not, commit their full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and our search for an initial business combination and their other businesses. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Each of our officers is engaged in other business endeavors for which he may be entitled to substantial compensation and our officers are not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours per week to our affairs. Our independent directors may also serve as officers or board members for other entities. If our officers\u2019 and directors\u2019 other business affairs require them to devote substantial amounts of time to such affairs in excess of their current commitment levels, it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs which may have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination. For a complete discussion of our officers\u2019 and directors\u2019 other business affairs, please see the section of this Form 10-K entitled \u201cManagement\u2014Directors and Officers.\u201d Certain of our officers and directors are now, and all of them may in the future become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time and determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. Until we consummate our initial business combination, we intend to engage in the business of identifying and combining with one or more businesses. Our Sponsor and officers and directors are, and may in the future become, affiliated with entities (such as operating companies or investment vehicles) that are engaged in a similar business, and our officers and directors may become an officer or director of another special purpose acquisition company with a class of securities intended to be registered under the Exchange Act even before we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination. Our officers and directors also may become aware of business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us and the other entities to which they owe certain fiduciary or contractual duties. Accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to another entity prior to its presentation to us. Our certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation. 35",

We have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, officers, security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary or financial interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. In fact, we may enter into an initial business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our Sponsor, our directors or officers, although we do not intend to do so. We do not have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. Accordingly, such persons or entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours. We may engage in an initial business combination with one or more target businesses that have relationships with entities that may be affiliated with our Sponsor, officers, directors or existing holders which may raise potential conflicts of interest. In light of the involvement of our Sponsor, officers and directors with other entities, we may decide to acquire one or more businesses affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors. Our directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities, including, without limitation, those described under the section of this Form 10-K entitled \u201cConflicts of Interest.\u201d Such entities may compete with us for business combination opportunities. We may pursue a transaction with an affiliated entity if we determined that such affiliated entity meets our criteria for an initial business combination as set forth in the section of this Form 10-K entitled \u201cSelection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination\u201d and such transaction was approved by a majority of our disinterested directors. Despite our agreement to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or from another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, regarding the fairness to our stockholders from a financial point of view of an initial business combination with one or more businesses affiliated with our officers, directors or existing holders, potential conflicts of interest still may exist and, as a result, the terms of the initial business combination may not be as advantageous to our public stockholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest. Our management may not be able to maintain control of a target business after our initial business combination. We may structure an initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction that does not meet such criteria. Even if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares of Class A common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares of common stock, our stockholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority stockholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company\u2019s stock than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain our control of the target business. New management may not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business. Changes in the market for directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and complete an initial business combination. In recent months, the market for directors and officers liability insurance for special purpose acquisition companies has changed. Fewer insurance companies are offering quotes for directors and officers liability coverage, the premiums charged for such policies have generally increased and the terms of such policies have generally become less favorable. There can be no assurance that these trends will not continue. 36",

Our business will be to identify and complete an initial business combination and thereafter to operate the post-transaction business or assets for the long term. We do not plan to buy businesses or assets with a view to resale or profit from their resale. We do not plan to buy unrelated businesses or assets or to be a passive investor. We do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act. To this end, the proceeds held in the trust account may only be invested in United States \u201cgovernment securities\u201d within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the trustee is not permitted to invest in other securities or assets. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, and by having a business plan targeted at acquiring and growing businesses for the long term (rather than on buying and selling businesses in the manner of a merchant bank or private equity fund), we intend to avoid being deemed an \u201cinvestment company\u201d within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. Investment in our company is not intended for persons who are seeking a return on investments in government securities or investment securities. The trust account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earliest to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business combination; (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame set forth in our certificate of incorporation or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders\u2019 rights or pre-initial business combination activity; or (iii) absent an initial business combination within the prescribed time frame set forth in our certificate of incorporation, our return of the funds held in the trust account to our public stockholders as part of our redemption of the public shares. If we do not invest the proceeds as discussed above, we may be deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act. If we were deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to complete an initial business combination or may result in our liquidation. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately the current value, as of April 1, 2024, per share or less on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. On March 11, 2024, the NYSE suspended trading of our securities on the NYSE and commenced proceedings to delist our securities from trading on its exchange and on March 26, 2024 our securities were delisted from the NYSE, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions. On March 11, 2024, we received correspondence from the staff of the NYSE indicating that the staff had determined to commence proceedings to delist our securities pursuant to Section 802.01B of the NYSE\u2019s Listed Company Manual because the Company had fallen below the NYSE\u2019s continued listing standard requiring a listed acquisition company to maintain an average aggregate global market capitalization attributable to its publicly-held shares over a consecutive 30 trading day period of at least $40,000,000. Trading of our securities on the NYSE was suspended immediately and on March 26, 2024 our securities were delisted from the NYSE. Effective as of March 12, 2024, our securities may be quoted and traded in the over-the-counter (OTC Pink) market under the ticker symbols \u201cIRRX,\u201d \u201cIRRXU,\u201d and \u201cIRRXW,\u201d respectively. The Company intends to seek a listing of its securities on the Nasdaq Stock Market prior to or in connection with the consummation of any business combination the Company may seek to consummate. However, we cannot assure our stockholders that our securities will be listed on Nasdaq or other stock exchange in the future or prior to our initial business combination. In order to list our securities on a stock exchange prior to our initial business combination, we must maintain certain financial, distribution and stock price levels. In addition, we must maintain a minimum number of holders of our securities.

We cannot assure our stockholders or potential investors that we will be able to do so if, for example, any facts or events arise which represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement or Form 10-K, the financial statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current or correct or the SEC issues a stop order. If the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act, we will be required to permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. However, no warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration is available. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective within a specified period following the consummation of our initial business combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. We will use our best efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. In no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant, or issue securities or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under applicable state securities laws and there is no exemption available. If the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or qualified or exempt from registration or qualification, the holder of such warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of units will have paid the full unit purchase price solely for the shares of Class A common stock included in the units. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may not exercise our redemption right if the issuance of shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable state blue sky laws or we are unable to effect such registration or qualification. We will use our best efforts to register or qualify such shares of common stock under the blue sky laws of the state of residence in those states in which the warrants were offered by us. However, there may be instances in which holders of our public warrants may be unable to exercise such public warrants but holders of our private warrants may be able to exercise such private warrants. If a warrant holder exercises their public warrants on a \u201ccashless basis,\u201d they will receive fewer shares of Class A common stock from such exercise than if they were to exercise such warrants for cash. There are circumstances in which the exercise of the public warrants may be required or permitted to be made on a cashless basis. First, if a registration statement covering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th business day after the closing of our initial business combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. Second, if a registration statement covering the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective within a specified period following the consummation of our initial business combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available; if that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. Third, if we call the public warrants for redemption, our management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants to do so on a cashless basis. In the event of an exercise on a cashless basis, a holder would pay the warrant exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the \u201cfair market value\u201d (as defined in the next sentence) by (y) the fair market value. The \u201cfair market value\u201d is the average reported last sale price of the Class A common stock for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of exercise is received by the warrant agent or on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants, as applicable. As a result, a warrant holder would receive fewer shares of Class A common stock from such exercise than if they were to exercise such warrants for cash. 40",

We may redeem our stockholders\u2019 unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to our stockholders, thereby making their warrants worthless. We have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sales price of our Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which we give proper notice of such redemption and provided certain other conditions are met. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may not exercise our redemption right if the issuance of shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable state blue sky laws or we are unable to effect such registration or qualification. We will use our best efforts to register or qualify such shares of common stock under the blue sky laws of the state of residence in those states in which the warrants were offered by us. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force our stockholders (i) to exercise their warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for our stockholders to do so, (ii) to sell their warrants at the then-current market price when our stockholders might otherwise wish to hold their warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of their warrants. None of the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. Our warrants and founder shares may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A common stock and make it more difficult to effectuate our initial business combination. We issued warrants to purchase 11,500,000 shares of our Class A common stock as part of the units offered in the IPO and we issued Private Placement Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 9,400,000 shares of Class A common stock at $11.50 per share. Our initial stockholders and the anchor investors in the IPO currently own an aggregate of 5,750,000 founder shares. The founder shares are convertible into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment as set forth herein. In addition, if our Sponsor makes any working capital loans, up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be converted into warrants, at the price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. Such warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. To the extent we issue shares of Class A common stock to effectuate an initial business combination, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares of Class A common stock upon exercise of these warrants and conversion rights could make us a less attractive business combination vehicle to a target business. Any such issuance will increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and reduce the value of the shares of Class A common stock issued to complete the initial business combination. Therefore, our warrants and founder shares may make it more difficult to effectuate an initial business combination or increase the cost of acquiring the target business. 43",

Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Our certificate of incorporation provides that the exclusive forum provision is applicable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, subject to certain exceptions.

As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

An investment in our securities, and certain subsequent transactions with respect to our securities, may result in uncertain U.S. federal income tax consequences for an investor. For instance, because there are no authorities that directly address the federal income tax implications of instruments similar to the units we issued in the IPO, the allocation an investor makes with respect to the purchase price of a unit between the share of Class A common stock and the one-half of one warrant to purchase one share of our Class A common stock included in each unit could be challenged by the Internal Revenue Service, or \u201cIRS,\u201d or the courts. Furthermore, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of a cashless exercise of warrants included in the units we issued as part of the IPO is unclear under current law. Finally, it is unclear whether the redemption rights with respect to our shares of Class A common stock suspend the running of a U.S. holder\u2019s holding period for purposes of determining whether any gain or loss realized by such holder on the sale or exchange of Class A common stock is long-term capital gain or loss and for determining whether any dividend we pay would be considered \u201cqualified dividends\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Prospective investors are urged to consult and rely on their tax advisors with respect to these and other tax consequences applicable to their specific circumstances when purchasing, holding, or disposing of our securities. Our warrant agreement designates the courts of the State of New York located in the in the Borough of Manhattan or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as the exclusive forums for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of our warrants, which could limit the ability of warrant holders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with our company. 46",

General Risk Factors We have no operating history and are subject to a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution requirement if we do not complete our initial Business Combination by April 16, 2024 (which is subject to monthly extensions through November 15, 2024). As such, there is a risk that we will be unable to continue as a going concern if we do not consummate an initial Business Combination within the prescribed time frame. If we are unable to effect an initial Business Combination by the applicable date, we will be forced to liquidate. We are a blank check company and have no operating history. Because we are subject to a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution requirement, there is a risk that we will be unable to continue as a going concern if we do not consummate an initial Business Combination within the prescribed time frame, subject to extensions, as further described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We expect to incur significant costs in pursuit of our financing and acquisition plans. Our plans to raise capital and to consummate our initial Business Combination may not be successful. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K do not include any adjustments that might result from our inability to continue as a going concern. In addition, prior to the completion of the IPO, the Company lacked the liquidity it needed to sustain operations for a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be one year from the issuance date of the financial statements. The Company has since completed its IPO at which time capital in excess of the funds deposited in the trust account and/or used to fund offering expenses was released to the Company for general working capital purposes. The Company used these funds primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses to complete an initial business combination. Because the Company\u2019s initial estimates of the costs of completing an initial business combination were less than the actual amount necessary to do so, it had insufficient funds available to operate the business prior to the initial business combination. Furthermore, because the term for entering into a business combination has been extended as further described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company has needed to raise additional funds to meet the expenditures required for operating its business through such extension dates. If the Company is unable to complete an initial business combination due to insufficient available funds, it will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, the Sponsor or any affiliates of the Sponsor, may continue to, but are not obligated to, loan funds to the Company on a non-interest basis as may be required. In the event that an initial business combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from the trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants, identical to the private placement warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The Company does not expect to seek loans from parties other than the sponsor or any affiliates of the Sponsor. Additionally, the Company could suspend payments on the administrative service agreement (as discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) to conserve working capital. In connection with the Company\u2019s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with ASC 205-40, Going Concern, management believes that the Company currently has less than 12 months to complete a Business Combination and if the Company is unsuccessful in consummating an Initial Business Combination, it is required to liquidate and dissolve. In connection with the Company\u2019s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2014-15, \u201cDisclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,\u201d management has determined that these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. We are a company with no operating history and no revenues, and our stockholders have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective. We are a company with no operating results. Because we lack an operating history, our stockholders have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective of completing our initial business combination with one or more target businesses. We currently have no definitive plans, arrangements or understandings with any prospective target business concerning an initial business combination and may be unable to complete our initial business combination. If we fail to complete our initial business combination, we will never generate any operating revenues. Past performance by our management team and its affiliates may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in the Company. Past performance by our management team and its affiliates is not a guarantee either (i) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate or (ii) that we will be able to locate a suitable candidate for our initial business combination. Our stockholders should not rely on the historical record of our management team or their affiliates\u2019 performance as indicative of our future performance of an investment in the company or the returns the company will, or is likely to, generate going forward. Additionally, in the course of their respective careers, members of our management team and their affiliates have been involved in businesses and transactions that were not successful. 47",

On January 24, 2024, the SEC adopted the 2024 SPAC Rules relating to, among other items, enhanced disclosure requirements in initial business combination transactions involving SPACs and private operating companies; amended financial statement requirements applicable to transactions involving shell companies; enhanced disclosure requirements related to projections, including required disclosure of all material bases of the projections and all material assumptions underlying the projections; increasing the potential liability of certain participants in proposed initial business combination transactions; and the extent to which SPACs could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act. The 2024 SPAC Rules will become effective no sooner than 125 days after publication in the Federal Register.

However, interest previously earned on the funds held in the trust account still may be released to us to pay our taxes, if any. As a result, any decision to liquidate the investments held in the trust account and thereafter to hold all funds in the trust account in cash items would reduce the dollar amount our public stockholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company. In addition, we may be deemed to be an investment company. The longer that the funds in the trust account are held in short-term U.S. government treasury obligations or in money market funds invested exclusively in such securities, the greater the risk that we may be considered an unregistered investment company, in which case we may be required to liquidate the Company. Accordingly, we may determine, in our discretion, to liquidate the securities held in the trust account at any time, even prior to the Stockholder Meeting, and instead hold all funds in the trust account in as cash items which would further reduce the dollar amount our public stockholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company. Were we to liquidate, our warrants would expire worthless, and our securityholders would lose the investment opportunity associated with an investment in the combined company, including any potential price appreciation of our securities. We are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies. We are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile. Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. Additionally, we are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K.

We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible. 49",

We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash derived from the proceeds of our initial public offering in March 12, 2021 (the \u201cInitial Public Offering\u201d or \u201cIPO\u201d) and the sale of the 9,400,000 warrants (the \u201cPrivate Placement Warrants\u201d) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to the Sponsor, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt. Initially, the Company had 12 months from the closing of the IPO on November 16, 2021 to consummate an initial Business Combination (until November 16, 2022). However, if the Company anticipated it was not able to consummate an initial Business Combination within such 12 month period, the insiders or their affiliates were entitled to, but were not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination up to two times by an additional three months each time (for a total of up to 18 months to complete a Business Combination) by depositing into the trust account maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company (now Equiniti), acting as trustee, an amount of $0.10 per unit sold to the public in the IPO, $2,300,000, for each such three-month extension (resulting in a total deposit of $10.30 per public share sold in the event all two extensions were elected or an aggregate of $4,600,000, if the time to consummate a Business Combination was extended to a full 18 months). Public stockholders were not entitled to vote on or redeem their shares in connection with any such extension. In November 2022, the Sponsor deposited $2,300,000 into the trust account, as a capital contribution, to extend the deadline for an initial business combination three months to February 2023. In lieu of a second $2,300,000 extension payment for a three month extension to May 2023, a Special meeting of Stockholders was held in February 2023 that resulted in extension of the deadline to complete an initial business combination to March 15, 2023 and allowed the Company to further extend the date to consummate a business combination on a monthly basis up to five (5) times by an additional one month through September 15, 2023. In connection with the vote on the extension Amendment at the Special Meeting, stockholders holding a total of 9,155,918 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata of the funds in the Company\u2019s trust account. As a result, $94,489,075 (approximately $10.32 per share) was withdrawn from the trust account to pay such holders. Our Sponsor deposited $692,204 each month from February 2023 through July 2023 as a sponsor loan into the Trust Account, extending the deadline for an initial business combination by one month each time to August 15, 2023. On August 8, 2023, the Company held an Annual Meeting. Stockholders to vote on the Second Extension Amendment Proposal and other proposals. The Second Extension Amendment Proposal permitted an extension of the date by which the Company had to consummate a business combination until February 15, 2024. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by the applicable deadline or by February 15, 2024, (as later extended, the \u201cCombination Period\u201d), (1) the Company effectuate a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses (an \u201cinitial business combination\u201d), (2) cease its operations except for the purpose of winding up if it fails to complete such initial business combination, and (3) redeem 100% of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock (\u201cClass A common stock\u201d) included as part of the units sold in the Company\u2019s initial public offering that was consummated on November 16, 2021 (the \u201cIPO\u201d), from August 15, 2023 to September 15, 2023, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to further extend such date to consummate a business combination on a monthly basis up to five (5) times by an additional one (1) month each time after September 15, 2023 or later extended deadline date, by resolution of the Company\u2019s board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d), if requested by the Sponsor, upon five days\u2019 advance notice prior to the applicable deadline date, until February 15, 2024, or a total of up to six (6) months after August 15, 2023 (such date as previously extended), unless the closing of a business combination shall have occurred prior thereto. In connection with the vote on the extension Amendment at the Annual Meeting, stockholders holding a total of 7,354,836 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Company\u2019s trust account. As a result, approximately $79,652,874 (approximately $10.83 per share) was removed from the Company\u2019s trust account to pay such holders. Following redemptions, and as the filing of this report, the Company has 6,489,246 shares outstanding. The Sponsor deposited $140,000, monthly, from August 2023 to December 2023, as a sponsor loan into the Trust Account, further extending the deadline for an initial business combination from August 15, 2023, to December 15, 2023.

The Company made the $50,000 extension deposits into the Trust Account in February, March and April 2024, extending the date to complete the business combination to May 15, 2024. We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a Business Combination will be successful. Results of Operations We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any operating revenues to date. Our only activities from inception through December 31, 2023 were organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering and an initial Business Combination, described below. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial Business Combination. We expect to generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held after the initial Public Offering. We expect that we will incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence and other expenses in connection with searching for, and completing, a Business Combination. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we had a net income of $3,543,111, which consisted of operating costs of $1,391,654, a provision for income taxes of $1,018,482, offset by the interest and income earned on cash and investment in the Trust Account of $5,117,247 and a gain on change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $836,000. For the year ended December 31, 2022 we had a net loss from operations of $2,036,415, which consisted of operating and business combination costs. Liquidity and Capital Resources On November 16, 2021, we completed the Initial Public Offering of 23,000,000 units of our class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, (the \u201cPublic Shares\u201d) and one-half of one redeemable warrant (the \u201cUnits\u201d), which includes the full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 3,000,000 Units, at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $230,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we completed the sale of 9,400,000 Private Placement Warrants to the Sponsor at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant generating gross proceeds of $9,400,000. Following the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, a total of $232,300,000 was placed in the Trust Account, and we had $1,712,612 of cash held outside of the Trust Account after payment of costs related to the Initial Public Offering, and available for working capital purposes. We incurred $24,917,410 in transaction costs, including $4,600,000 of underwriting fees, $8,050,000 of deferred underwriting fees, $11,675,823 for the excess fair value of Founder Shares attributable to the anchor investors, and $591,587 of other offering costs. In connection with the vote on an amendment to the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the date by which the company must effect the Business Combination (an \u201cextension Amendment\u201d) at the Special Meeting of Stockholders of our Company on February 8, 2023, stockholders holding a total of 9,155,918 shares of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, cash used in financing activities was $168,570,019 and affected by proceeds from a note payable from Sponsor, and a related party of the Company and other loans outstanding for $4,853,225, advances and proceeds from related party of $100,770 and $617,935, respectively and a payment to redeeming stockholders for $174,141,949. For the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in operating activities was $1,241,114. Net income of $9,584,028 was impacted by $8,996,400 of change in the fair value of the warrant liabilities related to the outstanding public and private warrants, $1,986,491 of income on investments held in the Trust Account, and $1,239,168 of unrealized gains on investments held in the Trust Account for the year ended December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, the Company held $237,537,270 of investments in the Trust Account at fair value in a fund invested in United States Treasury instruments. As of December 31, 2023, the Company withdrew funds for payment to redeeming stockholders totaling $174,141,949. At December 31, 2023, the fair value of the investments held in the Trust Account was $72,731,536 as recognized on the balance sheet. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account, which interest shall be net of taxes payable and excluding deferred underwriting commissions, to complete a Business Combination. We may withdraw interest from the Trust Account to pay taxes, if any. To the extent that our share capital or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete a Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. During the period ended December 31, 2023, the Company used $634,257 of interest earned in the Trust Account to pay income taxes. At December 31, 2023, we had cash of $189 held outside of the Trust Account, advances from related parties for $100,770 used for working capital purposes, a Note Payable due to the Sponsor of the Company for $4,853,225 for extension purposes, a Note Payable due to a related party used for working capital purposes of $600,000 and an additional working capital loan due to the Sponsor of the Company for $17,935. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination. 56",

If the Company is unable to complete an initial Business Combination due to insufficient available funds, it will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. At December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $189 in cash and $9,237,275 in working capital deficiency. The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans and while the Company believes it has sufficient access to additional sources of capital, there are no assurances that such additional capital will ultimately be available. In addition, the Company currently has less than 12 months from the date these financial statements were issued to complete a Business Combination and if the Company is unsuccessful in consummating an initial Business Combination, it is required to liquidate and dissolve. In connection with the Company\u2019s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 205-40, \u201cPresentation of Financial Statements \u2013 Going Concern\u201d, management has determined that these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. As is customary for a special purpose acquisition company, if the Company is not able to consummate a Business Combination during the combination period, it will cease all operations and redeem the Public Shares. Management plans to continue its efforts to consummate a Business Combination during the combination period. Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2023. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. Contractual Obligations During the period ended December 31, 2023, we entered into a promissory note with a related party for up to $600,000 to fund working capital. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2023, an affiliate of the Sponsor loaned us $4,853,225 to fund costs related to the extension of the date by which the Company must consummate an initial Business Combination pursuant to the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended on February 9, 2023, August 8, 2023 and February 12, 2024). We also have an agreement to pay an affiliate of the Sponsor a monthly fee of $10,000 for office space, secretarial, and administrative services provided to the Company (except where waived, as described above under Item 1 Business - Sources of Target Businesses and elsewhere in this report). We will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of a Business Combination and the Company\u2019s liquidation. The underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of $0.35 per Unit, or approximately $8.1 million. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. Critical Accounting Estimates Management\u2019s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our financial information. We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 2 \u2013 Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Financial Statements included in this report. Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain of our accounting policies require that management apply significant judgments in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates. On an ongoing basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. Some of the more significant estimates are in connection with determining the fair value of the warrant liabilities. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and, therefore, actual results could differ from our estimates. 57",

In September 2021, our Sponsor forfeited 2,156,250 founder shares, resulting in our Sponsor holding 5,750,000 founder shares, for which it paid approximately $0.004 per share on a post-forfeiture basis. The $25,000 proceeds were used to cover certain offering and formation costs. Interests in an aggregate of 100,000 of such shares were subsequently granted to certain of our directors and an aggregate of 1,515,160 of such shares were cancelled by our Sponsor and reissued by us to our anchor investors in the IPO. Our Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 9,400,000 warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant ($9,400,000 in the aggregate) each exercisable to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, in a private placement that closed simultaneously with the closing of the IPO on November 16, 2021. These warrants are referenced herein as the private placement warrants. The private placement warrants (including the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise thereof) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination.",

            "context": "69 We initially had 12 months from the closing of our IPO on November 16, 2021 to consummate an initial business combination, which has been extended as further discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may, but we are not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination up to 36 months (i.e., up to November 15, 2024) pursuant to the extensions, as further described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Public stockholders will not be offered the opportunity to vote on or redeem their shares in connection with any remaining monthly extension. In the event that we elect to extend the time to complete a business combination and our Sponsor (or its affiliates or designees) deposit the applicable amount of money into the trust, our Sponsor (or such affiliates or designees) would receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note equal to the amount of any such deposit that will not be repaid in the event that we are unable to close a business combination unless there are funds available outside the trust account to do so. Our Sponsor (and its affiliates or designees) are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within the applicable time period, we will, as promptly as possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. However, we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors that may take priority over the claims of our public stockholders. As more fully discussed in the section of this Form 10-K entitled \u201cConflicts of Interest,\u201d if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an initial business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such other entity. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. Commencing on June 16, 2021 we agreed to pay our Sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. During 2022, our Sponsor waived 2 months, or $20,000, of such administrative fees, and in 2023 our Sponsor waived 7 months, or $70,000, of such administrative fees. Other than the foregoing, no compensation of any kind, including any finder\u2019s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee or monies in respect of any payment of a loan, will be paid by us to our Sponsor, officers and directors, or any affiliates of our Sponsor or officers, prior to, or in connection with any services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation of an initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, these individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. We do not have a policy that prohibits our Sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, from negotiating for the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses by a target business. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our Sponsor, officers, directors or our or their affiliates and will determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf. On June 16, 2021 our Sponsor agreed to loan us up to $1,800,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of the initial public offering. As of June 30, 2021, we borrowed $25,000 in funds (of up to $1,800,000 available to us) under the promissory note with our Sponsor to be used for a portion of the expenses of the IPO. These loans were non-interest bearing, unsecured and were due at the earlier of December 31, 2021 or the closing of the IPO. The loan was repaid upon the closing of the IPO out of the estimated $1,800,000 of offering proceeds that had been allocated to the payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions). The value of our Sponsor\u2019s interest in this transaction corresponded to the principal amount outstanding under any such loan. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our Sponsor or any affiliates of our Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds on a non-interest bearing basis as may be required. If we complete an initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital, if any, held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our Sponsor or any affiliates of our Sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. 70",

The Company was advanced $100,770 for the year ended December 31, 2023 for working capital purposes. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2023, and affiliate of the Sponsor loaned us $4,433,225 to fund costs related to the extension of the date by which the Company must consummate an initial Business Combination. After our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, furnished to our stockholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of distribution of such tender offer materials or at the time of a stockholder meeting held to consider our initial business combination, as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation. We have entered into a registration and stockholder rights agreement with respect to the private placement warrants, the warrants issuable upon conversion of working capital loans (if any) and the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the foregoing and upon conversion of the founder shares, and, upon consummation of our initial business combination, to nominate three individuals for election to our board of directors, as long as the Sponsor holds any securities covered by the registration and stockholder rights agreement. On November 16, 2021, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we sold to our Sponsor an aggregate of 9,400,000 warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant ($9,400,000 in the aggregate), each exercisable to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. These warrants are referenced herein as the private placement warrants. The Private Warrants are identical to the Warrants sold in the IPO except that the Private Warrants are non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the Sponsor, or its permitted transferees. Additionally, our Sponsor agreed not to transfer, assign, or sell any of the Private Warrants or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances, as described in the Private Placement Warrants Subscription Statement) until the date we complete our initial business combination. The Sponsor was granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the purchase of the Private Warrants. In order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of our IPO, our initial stockholders, officers and directors and their respective affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would be repaid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest. The holders of our insider shares issued and outstanding on the date of this annual report, as well as the holders of the Private Placement Warrants (and all underlying securities) are entitled to registration rights pursuant to the registration rights agreement, dated November 11, 2021. The holders of a majority of these securities are entitled to make up to two demands that we register such securities. The holders of the majority of the insider shares can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which these shares of common stock are to be released from escrow. The holders of a majority of the private warrants can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time after we consummate a business combination. In addition, the holders have certain \u201cpiggy-back\u201d registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our consummation of a business combination. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. We reimburse our officers and directors for any reasonable out-of-pocket business expenses incurred by them in connection with certain activities on our behalf such as identifying and investigating possible target businesses and business combinations. There is no limit on the amount of out-of-pocket expenses reimbursable by us; provided, however, that to the extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account and the interest income earned on the amounts held in the trust account, such expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an initial business combination. Our audit committee reviews and approves all reimbursements and payments made to any initial stockholder or member of our management team, or our or their respective affiliates, and any reimbursements and payments made to members of our audit committee are reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors, with any interested director abstaining from such review and approval. 71",

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 \u2013 DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION, BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AND GOING CONCERN Integrated Rail and Resources Acquisition Corp. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation on March 12, 2021 . The Company was incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (\u201cBusiness Combination\u201d). As of December 31, 2023, the Company had not yet commenced operations. All activity for the period from March 12, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2023 related to the Company\u2019s formation, its initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d or \u201cInitial Public Offering\u201d), which is described below, and, subsequent to the IPO, identifying a target company for an initial Business Combination. The registration statement for the Company\u2019s IPO was declared effective on November 11, 2021. On November 16, 2021, the Company consummated its IPO of 23,000,000 units (the \u201cUnits\u201d), including the full exercise of the underwriters\u2019 over-allotment option to purchase 3,000,000 Units. Each Unit consisted of one share of Class A common stock, par value $ 0.0001 per share, of the Company (the \u201cPublic Shares\u201d) and one-half of one redeemable warrant, at $ 10.00 per Unit. The Units were sold at a price of $ 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $ 230,000,000 , which is described in Note 3. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock for $ 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the sale of 9,400,000 warrants (the \u201cPrivate Placement Warrants\u201d) at a price of $ 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to DHIP Natural Resources Investments, LLC (\u201cSponsor\u201d), generating gross proceeds of $ 9,400,000 , which is described in Note 4. Transaction costs amounted to $ 24,917,410 consisting of $ 4,600,000 of underwriting fees, $ 8,050,000 of deferred underwriting fees, $ 11,675,823 for the excess fair value of Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5 below) attributable to the anchor investors (as described in Note 3), and $ 591,587 of other offering costs. Initially, the Company had 12 months from the closing of the IPO on November 16, 2021 to consummate an initial Business Combination (until November 16, 2022). However, if the Company anticipated it was not able to consummate an initial Business Combination within such 12 month period, the insiders or their affiliates were entitled to, but were not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination up to two times by an additional three months each time (for a total of up to 18 months to complete a Business Combination) by depositing into the trust account maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee, an amount of $ 0.10 per unit sold to the public in the IPO, $ 2,300,000 , for each such three-month extension (resulting in a total deposit of $ 10.30 per public share sold in the event all two extensions were elected or an aggregate of $ 4,600,000 , if the time to consummate a Business Combination was extended to a full 18 months). Public stockholders were not entitled to vote on or redeem their shares in connection with any such extension. In November 2022, the Sponsor deposited $ 2,300,000 into the trust account, as a capital contribution, to extend the deadline for an initial business combination three months to February 2023. In lieu of a second $ 2,300,000 extension payment for a three month extension to May 2023, a Special meeting of Stockholders was held in February 2023 that resulted in extension of the deadline to complete an initial business combination to March 15, 2023 and allowed the Company to further extend the date to consummate a business combination on a monthly basis up to five (5) times by an additional one month through September 15, 2023. In connection with the vote on the extension Amendment at the Special Meeting, stockholders holding a total of 9,155,918 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata of the funds in the Company\u2019s trust account. As a result, $ 94,489,075 (approximately $ 10.32 per share) was withdrawn from the trust account to pay such holders. Our Sponsor deposited $ 692,204 each month from February 2023 through July 2023 as a sponsor loan into the Trust Account, extending the deadline for an initial business combination by one month each time to August 15, 2023. On August 8, 2023, the Company held the Annual Meeting. Stockholders voted on the Second Extension Amendment Proposal and other proposals. The Second Extension Amendment Proposal permitted an extension of the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination until February 15, 2024. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by the applicable deadline or by February 15, 2024, (the \u201cCombination Period\u201d), (1) the Company effectuate a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses (an \u201cinitial business combination\u201d), (2) cease its operations except for the purpose of winding up if it fails to complete such initial business combination, and (3) redeem 100 % of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock (\u201cClass A common stock\u201d) included as part of the units sold in the Company\u2019s initial public offering that was consummated on November 16, 2021 (the \u201cIPO\u201d), from August 15, 2023 to September 15, 2023, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to further extend such date to consummate a business combination on a monthly basis up to five (5) times by an additional one (1) month each time after September 15, 2023 or later extended deadline date, by resolution of the Company\u2019s board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d), if requested by the Sponsor, upon five days\u2019 advance notice prior to the applicable deadline date, until February 15, 2024, or a total of up to six (6) months after August 15, 2023 (such date as previously extended), unless the closing of a business combination shall have occurred prior thereto. F-7 INTEGRATED RAIL AND RESOURCES ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 \u2013 DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION, BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AND GOING CONCERN \u2013 Continued In connection with the vote on the extension Amendment at the Annual Meeting, stockholders holding a total of 7,354,836 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Company\u2019s trust account. As a result, approximately $ 79,652,874 (approximately $ 10.83 per share) was removed from the Company\u2019s trust account to pay such holders. Following redemptions, and as the filing of this report, the Company has 6,489,246 shares outstanding. The Sponsor deposited $ 140,000 , monthly, from August 2023 to December 2023, as a sponsor loan into the Trust Account, further extending the deadline for an initial business combination from August 15, 2023, to December 15, 2023. During the period ended December 31, 2023, the Company has deposited a total of $ 4,853,225 for extension purposes. On February 12, 2024 at a Special Meeting in Lieu of an Annual Meetings of Stockholders of the Company (the \u201cSpecial Meeting\u201d), the Company filed a Third Amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State on February 12, 2024 following stockholder approval of a proposal (the \u201cThird Extension Amendment Proposal\u201d) to extend the date by which the Company must (1) effectuate a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses (an \u201cinitial business combination\u201d), (2) cease its operations except for the purpose of winding up if it fails to complete such initial business combination, and (3) redeem 100 % of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock included as part of the units sold in the Company\u2019s initial public offering that was consummated on November 16, 2021 (the \u201cIPO\u201d), from February 15, 2024 to March 15, 2024, by depositing (or causing to be deposited) into the trust account (the \u201cTrust Account\u201d) $ 50,000 for such one-month extension on or prior to February 15, 2024, and to allow the Company, without another stockholder vote, to further extend such date to consummate a business combination on a monthly basis up to eight (8) times by an additional one (1) month each time after March 15, 2024 or later extended deadline date, by resolution of the Company\u2019s board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d), if requested by the Sponsor, upon five days\u2019 advance notice prior to the applicable deadline date, until November 15, 2024, or a total of up to nine (9) months after February 15, 2024 (such date as extended, the \u201cDeadline Date\u201d), by depositing (or causing to be deposited) into the Trust Account $ 50,000 for each additional one-month extension on or prior to each applicable Deadline Date, unless the closing of a business combination shall have occurred prior thereto.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 \u2013 DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION, BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AND GOING CONCERN \u2013 Continued On October 13 , 2023, November 15, 2023, December 15, 2023, and January 15, 2024 the Sponsor made deposits to the Trust Account of $ 140,000 , respectively, further, on February 15, 2024, March 15, 2024 and April 15, 2024 the Sponsor made deposits to the trust account of $ 50,000 respectively to further extend the period to consummate the Business Combination to May 15, 2024 (or such later extension date permitted by the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation in the event the stockholders of the Company approve a further amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period to consummate the Business Combination) (see Note 5). If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its income taxes, if any (less up to $ 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders\u2019 rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining stockholders and the board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), to the Company\u2019s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. The Company\u2019s management had broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of its Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds were applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. The Company\u2019s initial business combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80 % of the net assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time the Company signs a definitive agreement in connection with an initial business combination. However, the Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50 % or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Following the closing of the IPO on November 16, 2021, management agreed that an amount equal to at least $ 10.10 per Unit sold (or $ 232,300,000 ) in the Initial Public Offering and the proceeds of the Private Placement Warrants, would be held in a trust account (\u201cTrust Account\u201d) with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC acting as trustee and invested in United States \u201cgovernment securities\u201d within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below. The Company will provide its holders of the Public Shares (the \u201cPublic Stockholders\u201d) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The Public Stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $ 10.10 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). The per-share amount to be distributed to Public Stockholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters (as discussed in Note 6). The Public Shares are recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 480 \u201cDistinguishing Liabilities from Equity. The Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $ 5,000,001 upon such consummation of a Business Combination and a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation which was adopted by the Company upon the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, and was amended by certificates of amendment on February 9, 2023 and August 8, 2023 (the \u201cAmended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation\u201d), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d), and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, a stockholder approval of the transactions is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. F-9 INTEGRATED RAIL AND RESOURCES ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 \u2013 DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION, BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AND GOING CONCERN \u2013 Continued Additionally, each Public Stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the holders of the Founder Shares prior to this Initial Public Offering (the \u201cInitial Stockholders\u201d) will agree to vote their Founder Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of a business combination. In addition, the Initial Stockholders will agree to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and Public Shares in connection with the completion of a business combination. In addition, the Company has agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of the Sponsor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that a Public Stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than aggregate of 15 % or more of the Class A common stock sold in the Initial Public Offering, without the prior consent of the Company. The Company\u2019s Sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees agreed not to propose an amendment to the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of the Company\u2019s obligation to provide for the redemption of its Public Shares in connection with a Business Combination or to redeem 100 % of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination, unless the Company provides the Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A common stock in conjunction with any such amendment.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 \u2013 DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION, BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AND GOING CONCERN \u2013 Continued In connection with the redemption of 100 % of the Company\u2019s outstanding Public Shares for a portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, each holder will receive a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay the Company\u2019s taxes payable (less up to $ 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses). The Initial Stockholders agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the combination period. However, if the Initial Stockholders should acquire Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the combination period. The underwriters will agree to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within in the combination period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Company\u2019s Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be only $ 10.10 per share initially held in the Trust Account. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.10 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.10 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company\u2019s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have vendors, service providers (except the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. Liquidity and Going Concern At December 31, 2023, the Company had $ 189 in cash and $ 9,237,275 in working capital deficit. The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans and while the Company believes it has sufficient access to additional sources of capital, if necessary, there are no assurances that such additional capital will ultimately be available. In addition, the Company currently has less than 12 months from the date these financial statements were issued to complete a Business Combination and if the Company is unsuccessful in consummating an Initial Business Combination, it is required to liquidate and dissolve. In connection with the Company\u2019s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 205-40, \u201cPresentation of Financial Statements \u2013 Going Concern\u201d, management has determined that these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. As is customary for a special purpose acquisition company, if the Company is not able to consummate a Business Combination during the combination period, it will cease all operations and redeem the Public Shares. Management plans to continue its efforts to consummate a Business Combination during the combination period. Basis of Presentation The accompanying financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.

Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, but any such election to opt out is irrevocable.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 2 \u2013 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \u2013 Continued Fair Value of Financial Instruments The fair value of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASC 820\u201d), approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying balance sheets, primarily due to their short-term nature. The Company applies ASC 820, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value and clarifies the definition of fair value within the framework. ASC 820 defines fair value as an exit price, which is the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the Company\u2019s principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy established in ASC 820 generally requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. Unobservable inputs reflect the entity\u2019s own assumptions based on market data and the entity\u2019s judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are to be developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The carrying amounts reflected in the balance sheets for cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses, accrued offering costs, investments held in trust account, and due to related party approximate fair value due to short-term nature. Level 1\u2014Assets and liabilities with unadjusted, quoted prices listed on active market exchanges. Inputs to the fair value measurement are observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2\u2014Inputs to the fair value measurement are determined using prices for recently traded assets and liabilities with similar underlying terms, as well as direct or indirect observable inputs, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3\u2014Inputs to the fair value measurement are unobservable inputs, such as estimates, assumptions, and valuation techniques when little or no market data exists for the assets or liabilities. See Note 10 for additional information on assets and liabilities measured at fair value. Stock-based Compensation The transfer of the Founder Shares to independent directors is in the scope of FASB ASC Topic 718, \u201cCompensation-Stock Compensation\u201d (\u201cASC 718\u201d). Under ASC 718, stock-based compensation associated with equity-classified awards is measured at fair value upon the grant date. The Founders Shares were granted subject to a performance condition (i.e., the occurrence of a Business Combination). Compensation expense related to the Founders Shares is recognized only when the performance condition is probable of occurrence under the applicable accounting literature in this circumstance. As of the date the financial statements were issued, the Company determined that a Business Combination is not considered probable, and, therefore, no stock-based compensation expense has been recognized. Stock-based compensation would be recognized at the date a Business Combination is considered probable (i.e., upon completion of a Business Combination) in an amount equal to the number of Founders Shares that ultimately vest multiplied times the grant date fair value per share (uncles subsequently modified) less the amount initially received for the purchase of the Founders Shares. Income Taxes The Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC Topic 740, \u201cIncome Taxes,\u201d which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. ASC Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company\u2019s management determined that the United States is the Company\u2019s only major tax jurisdiction. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. Since the Company was incorporated on March 12, 2021, the evaluation was performed for the 2021 and 2022 tax years, which are the only periods subject to examination. F-15 INTEGRATED RAIL AND RESOURCES ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 2 \u2013 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \u2013 Continued Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (\u201cASU 2023-09\u201d), which will require the company to disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 will also require the company to disaggregate its income taxes paid disclosure by federal, state and foreign taxes, with further disaggregation required for significant individual jurisdictions. ASU 2023-09 will become effective for Annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The company is still reviewing the impact of ASU 2023-09. Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company\u2019s financial statements. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company had no cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Investments Held in Trust Account As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $ 72,731,536 of Money Market Funds which are invested primarily in U.S. Treasury Securities and cash funds held in the Trust Account. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company used $ 634,257 , of interest earned in the Trust Account to pay federal and state taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company paid $ 174,141,949 from the funds held in Trust related to redemption of Class A Common Stock as a result of the Special Meeting that occurred in February 2023 and August 2023 to extend the business combination date. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 237,537,270 of treasury bills, mutual funds, and cash funds held in the Trust Account. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company used $ 291,009 of interest earned in the Trust Account to pay taxes. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the \u201cIR Act\u201d) was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal 1 % excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its stockholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the \u201cTreasury\u201d) has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. Any redemption or other repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a Business Combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any \u201cPIPE\u201d or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of a Business Combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax have not been determined. Management has established a liability in the amount of $ 1,741,420 related to the excise tax included in current liabilities on the Company\u2019s balance sheets as of December 31, 2023. The Company confirms that when the extension is implemented, it will not withdraw any funds from the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account, to pay for the 1 % excise tax that may become due under the IR Act.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 3 \u2013 INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING Pursuant to the Initial Public Offering, the Company sold 23,000,000 Units, including the full exercise of the underwriters\u2019 over-allotment option to purchase 3,000,000 Units, at a purchase price of $ 10.00 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one Class A common stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant (\u201cPublic Warrant\u201d). Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $ 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. Twelve anchor investors, none of whom is affiliated with any member of our management team, purchased an aggregate of 20,000,000 of the units sold in the Initial Public Offering. Further, each such anchor investor purchased a pro-rata portion of 1,515,160 Founder Shares offered to the anchor investors at $ 0.004 per share. The Company considers the excess fair value of the Founder Shares issued to the anchor investors above the purchase price as offering costs and have reduced the gross proceeds by this amount. The Company has valued the excess fair value over consideration of the Founder Shares offered to the anchor investors at $ 11,675,823 . The excess of the fair value over consideration of the Founder Shares was determined to be an offering cost in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A and were allocated to stockholders\u2019 deficit and expenses upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering. The fair value of the shares was estimated to be $ 7.71 based on numerous assumptions including the probability of an acquisition, an estimated date of acquisition, the risk free rate on the acquisition date, a discount for a lack of marketability and other variables. The Sponsor and the Company\u2019s officers and directors have agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of their Private Placement Warrants until 30 days after the completion of the initial Business Combination. F-17 INTEGRATED RAIL AND RESOURCES ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 4 \u2013 PRIVATE PLACEMENT Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 9,400,000 Private Placement Warrants, at a price of $ 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant ($ 9.4 million in the aggregate). Each whole Private Placement Warrant is exercisable for one whole share of Class A common stock at a price of $ 11.50 per share. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants to the Sponsor were added to the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering to be held in the Trust Account such that at the time of closing $ 232,300,000 was held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the combination period, the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless. The Private Placement Warrants will be non-redeemable for cash and exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. NOTE 5 \u2013 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Founder Shares On March 12, 2021, the Sponsor paid an aggregate of $ 25,000 in exchange for issuance of 5,750,000 shares of Class B common stock (the \u201cFounder Shares\u201d). On April 5, 2021, the Sponsor transferred interests in the Sponsor that corresponded with 25,000 Founder Shares to each of Nathan Asplund, Rollin Bredenberg, Brian Feldott, and Edmund Underwood, Jr., our independent director nominees. In relation to the Initial Public Offering, an aggregate of 1,515,160 Founder Shares were cancelled by the Sponsor and transferred by us to our anchor investors in the IPO. Amounts previously reported as Class B common stock were retrospectively restated to account for this transaction. On March 7, 2022, Nathan Asplund tendered the return of his interest in the Sponsor (that corresponded with 25,000 Founder Shares) in relation to his resignation from the Board of Directors and the Sponsor transferred an interest in the Sponsor that corresponded with 25,000 Founder Shares to Troy Welch, who was elected to the Board of Directors on March 4, 2022 to fill the vacancy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sponsor retains all voting and disposition rights in the founders shares held by the Sponsor. The Company determined the fair value of the share-based compensation related to the transfer of interests in the Sponsor (that corresponded to Founder Shares), to the independent director nominees, based on numerous assumptions including the probability of an acquisition, an estimated date of acquisition, the risk free rate on the acquisition date, a discount for a lack of marketability and other variables. The value of the share based compensation was $ 667,250 based on grant date fair value estimates of $ 6.63 and $ 6.80 at April 5, 2021 and March 7, 2022, respectively. On November 15, 2022, the Company\u2019s CEO Richard Bertel, CFO Christopher Bertel, Vice President Edmund Underwood, director Rollin Bredenberg, and director Troy Welch tendered their resignation from the Company. In relation to such resignations, Mr. Bredenberg, Mr. Welch, and Mr. Underwood each tendered the return of their interest in the Sponsor (that corresponded with 25,000 Founder Shares) on November 21, 2022. The Company replaced the departed directors with Ronald Curt Copley, and Jason Reeves. On December 22, 2022, and December 24, 2022, the Sponsor transferred an interest in the Sponsor that corresponded with 25,000 Founder Shares to Ronald Curt Copley and Jason Reeves, respectively, as independent director nominees. The Company determined the fair value of the share-based compensation related to the transfer of the Sponsor interest (corresponding with Founder Shares), to the independent director nominees, based on numerous assumptions including the probability of an acquisition, an estimated date of acquisition, the risk-free rate on the acquisition date, a discount for a lack of marketability and other variables. The value of the share-based compensation was $ 74,637 based on grant date fair value estimates of $ 1.49 at both December 22, 2022, and December 24, 2022.

All unpaid principal under the Note Payable-Related Party was due and payable in full on the earlier of September 15, 2023 and the date on which the Company consummated an initial business combination. Pursuant to the terms of such note, Trident Point 2 has the option at any time prior to September 15, 2023 to convert amounts outstanding, up to $ 600,000 , into warrants to purchase the Company\u2019s shares of Class A common stock at a conversion price of $ 1.00 per warrant, with each warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $ 11.50 per share, subject to the same adjustments applicable to the private placement warrants sold concurrently with the Company\u2019s IPO. As of the date of this report, the Company has borrowed $ 600,000 on the promissory note. In May 2023, the Company issued an amended and restated unsecured promissory note, dated as of January 12, 2023, to Trident Point 2, LLC removing the warrant conversion feature from the promissory note and revising the maturity date so that all unpaid principal under the Note Payable-Related Party will be due and payable in full on December 15, 2023 (or such later extension date permitted by the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation) in the event the stockholders of the Company approve a further amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the period to consummate a Business Combination and the date on which the Company consummates an initial business combination.

As of December 31, 2023 the Company may still draw $ 3,546,775 on the note. In connection with the loans mentioned above, the sponsor made six monthly deposits to the Trust Account of $ 692,204 from February 2023 through July 2023. Additionally, they made six monthly deposits of $ 140,000 to the Trust Account during August 2023, September 2023, October 2023, November 2023, December 2023 and January 2024 into the Trust Account to extend the deadline for consummating a business combination to February 15, 2024 under the Note Payable-Sponsor.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 5 \u2013 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS \u2013 Continued Administrative Services Agreement The Company entered into an agreement commencing on the date that the Company\u2019s securities were first listed on the New York Stock Exchange through the earlier of consummation of an initial Business Combination and the liquidation, which provides that the Company will pay the Sponsor $ 10,000 per month for office space, secretarial and administrative services provided to the Company. In addition, the Sponsor, officers and directors, or their respective affiliates will be reimbursed for any out-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on the Company\u2019s behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on possible Business Combination targets. The Company\u2019s audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made by the Company to the Sponsor, executive officers or directors, or their affiliates. Any such payments prior to an initial Business Combination will be made using funds held outside the Trust Account. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded $ 120,000 , related to the administrative services agreement included in Operating Expenses on the Statement of Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded $ 100,000 , related to the administrative services agreement included in Operating Expenses on the Statement of Operations. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Sponsor waived 7 months, or $ 70,000 , of administrative fees and 2 months, or $ 20,000 , of administrative fees, respectively. F-21 INTEGRATED RAIL AND RESOURCES ACQUISITION CORP. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 6 \u2013 COMMITMENTS & CONTINGENCIES Registration and Stockholder Rights The holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants, and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans (and any shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans) will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration and stockholder rights agreement signed in relation to the Initial Public Offering. The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company registers such securities. In addition, the holders have certain \u201cpiggy-back\u201d registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of an initial Business Combination. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Underwriting Agreement The Company paid an underwriting discount of $ 0.20 per unit, or $ 4.6 million in the aggregate in relation to the Initial Public Officer, with an additional fee of $ 0.35 per unit, or approximately $ 8.05 million in the aggregate, payable to the underwriters for deferred underwriting commissions in relation to the Initial Public Offering. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. The Company accounted for the 20,900,000 warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering (the 11,500,000 Public Warrants and the 9,400,000 Private Placement Warrants) in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC815-40. Such guidance provides that because the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, each warrant must be recorded as a liability. Accordingly, the Company classified each warrant as a liability at its fair value. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement, the warrant liability will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in the Company\u2019s statements of operations. Warrants \u2014 Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional Public Warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole Public Warrants trade. The Public Warrants will become exercisable 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination; provided that the Company has an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available and such shares are registered, qualified or exempt from registration under the securities, or blue sky, laws of the state of residence of the holder (or the Company permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis under certain circumstances). The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 20 business days after the closing of an initial Business Combination, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC and have an effective registration statement covering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those Class A common stock until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the warrant agreement. If a registration statement covering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th day after the closing of an initial Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a \u201ccashless basis\u201d in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. Notwithstanding the above, if the Class A common stock are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a \u201ccovered security\u201d under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a \u201ccashless basis\u201d and, in the event the Company so elects, the Company will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, and in the event the Company does not so elect, it will use commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. Investment Banking Advisory Agreement The Company has entered into an investment banking advisory services agreement pursuant to which fees will be paid upon the closing of an acquisition during the term of the agreement through 24 months after the termination of the agreement. Fees will be charged at the greater of $ 4,250,000 or up to 0.65 % of the acquisition value if the acquisition value exceeds $ 900 million. The investment banking advisory fees are contingent on both the consummation and the specific terms of an initial Business Combination, neither of which can be reasonably predicted at this time. Accordingly, no accrual has been made for these arrangements in the financial statements. F-22",
